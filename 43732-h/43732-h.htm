<h3>
NARRATES HOW I CAME TO QUIT THE STUDY OF LATIN AND THE LIKE, AND TAKE TO
HARD WORK IN A MOORLAND COUNTRY
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is an odd thing, chance&mdash;the one element to baffle the logician
and make the scheming of the wisest look as foolish in the long run as the
sandy citadel a child builds upon the shore without any thought of the
incoming tide. A strange thing, chance; and but for chance I might this
day be the sheriff of a shire, my head stuffed with the tangled phrase and
sentiment of interlocutors, or maybe no more than an advocate overlooked,
sitting in John's Coffeehouse in Edinburgh&mdash;a moody soured man with a
jug of claret, and cursing the inconsistencies of preferment to office. I
might have been that, or less, if it had not been for so trifling a
circumstance as the burning of an elderly woman's batch of scones. Had
Mistress Grant a more attentive eye to her Culross griddle, what time the
scones for her lodgers, breakfast were a-baking forty years ago, I would
never have fled furth my native land in a mortal terror of the gallows:
had her griddle, say, been higher on the swee-chain by a link or two, Paul
Greig would never have foregathered with Dan Risk, the blackguard skipper
of a notorious craft; nor pined in a foreign jail; nor connived,
unwitting, at a prince's murder; nor marched the weary leagues of France
and fought there on a beggar's wage. And this is not all that hung that
long-gone day upon a woman's stair-head gossip to the neglect of her <i>cuisine</i>,
for had this woman been more diligent at her baking I had probably never
seen my Isobel with a lover's eye.
</p>
<p>
Well, here's one who can rarely regret the past except that it is gone. It
was hard, it was cruel often; dangers the most curious and unexpected
beset me, and I got an insight to deep villainies whereof man may be
capable; yet on my word, if I had the parcelling out of a second life for
myself, I think I would have it not greatly differing from the first, that
seems in God's providence like to end in the parish where it started,
among kent and friendly folk. I would not swear to it, yet I fancy I would
have Lucky Grant again gossiping on her stair-head and her scones burned
black, that Mackellar, my fellow-lodger, might make me once more, as he
used to do, the instrument of his malcontent.
</p>
<p>
I mind, as it were yesterday, his gloomy look at the platter that morn's
morning. &ldquo;Here they are again!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;fired to a cinder; it's always
that with the old wife, or else a heart of dough. For a bawbee I would
throw them in her face.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, not so much as that.&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;though it is mighty provoking.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm not thinking of myself,&rdquo; said he, always glooming at the platter with
his dark, wild Hielan' eye. &ldquo;I'm not thinking of myself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
it's something by way of an insult to you, that had to complain of
Sunday's haddocks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, as to them,&rdquo; quo' I, &ldquo;they did brawly for me; 'twas you put your
share in your pocket and threw it away on the Green. Besides the scones
are not so bad as they look&rdquo;&mdash;I broke one and ate; &ldquo;they're owre good
at least for a hungry man like me to send back where they came from.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His face got red. &ldquo;What's that rubbish about the haddocks and the Green?&rdquo;
 said he. &ldquo;You left me at my breakfast when you went to the Ram's Horn
Kirk.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that's true, Jock,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I think I have made no' so bad a
guess. You were feared to affront the landlady by leaving her ancient fish
on the ashet, and you egged me on to do the grumbling.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it's as sure as death, Paul,&rdquo; said he shamefacedly, &ldquo;I hate to vex
a woman. And you're a thought wrong in your guess&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed at his
own humour as he said it&mdash;&ldquo;for when you were gone to your kirk I
transferred my share of the stinking fish to your empty plate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He jouked his head, but scarcely quick enough, for my Sallust caught him
on the ear. He replied with a volume of Buchanan the historian, the man I
like because he skelped the Lord's anointed, James the First, and for a
time there was war in Lucky Grant's parlour room, till I threw him into
the recess bed snibbed the door, and went abroad into the street leaving
my room-fellow for once to utter his own complaints.
</p>
<p>
I went out with the itch of battle on me, and that was the consequence of
a woman's havering while scones burned, and likewise my undoing, for the
High Street when I came to it was in the yeasty ferment of encountering
hosts, their cries calling poor foolish Paul Greig like a trumpet.
</p>
<p>
It had been a night and morning of snow, though I and Mackellar, so high
in Lucky Grant's chamber in Crombie's Land, had not suspected it. The dull
drab streets, with their crazy, corbelled gable-ends, had been transformed
by a silent miracle of heaven into something new and clean; where noisome
gutters were wont to brim with slops there was the napkin of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
For ordinary I hated this town of my banishment; hated its tun-bellied
Virginian merchants, so constantly airing themselves upon the Tontine
piazza and seeming to suffer from prosperity as from a disease; and felt
no great love of its women&mdash;always so much the madame to a
drab-coated lad from the moorlands; suffered from its greed and stifled
with the stinks of it. &ldquo;Gardyloo! Gardyloo! Gardyloo!&rdquo; Faith! I hear that
evening slogan yet, and see the daunderers on the Rottenrow skurry like
rats into the closes to escape the cascades from the attic windows. And
while I think I loved learning (when it was not too ill to come by), and
was doing not so bad in my Humanities, the carven gateway of the college
in my two sessions of a scholar's fare never but scowled upon me as I
entered.
</p>
<p>
But the snow that morning made of the city a place wherein it was good to
be young, warm-clad, and hardy. It silenced the customary traffic of the
street, it gave the morning bells a song of fairydom and the valleys of
dream; up by-ordinary tall and clean-cut rose the crow-stepped walls, the
chimney heads, and steeples, and I clean forgot my constant fancy for the
hill of Ballageich and the heather all about it. And war raged. The
students faced 'prentice lads and the journeymen of the crafts with
volleys of snowballs; the merchants in the little booths ran out tremulous
and vainly cried the watch. Charge was made and counter-charge; the air
was thick with missiles, and close at hand the silver bells had their
merry sweet chime high over the city of my banishment drowned by the
voices taunting and defiant.
</p>
<p>
Merry was that day, but doleful was the end of it, for in the fight I
smote with a snowball one of the bailies of the burgh, who had come waving
his three-cocked hat with the pomp and confidence of an elected man and
ordering an instant stoppage of our war: he made more ado about the
dignity of his office than the breakage of his spectacles, and I was haled
before my masters, where I fear I was not so penitent as prudence would
advise.
</p>
<p>
Two days later my father came in upon Dawson's cart to convoy me home. He
saw the Principal, he saw the regents of the college, and up, somewhat
clashed and melancholy, he climbed to my lodging. Mackellar fled before
his face as it had been the face of the Medusa.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Paul,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;it seems we made a mistake about your
birthday.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; said I, without meaning, for I knew he was ironical.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It would seem so, at any rate,&rdquo; said he, not looking my airt at all, but
sideways to the window and a tremor in his voice. &ldquo;When your mother packed
your washing last Wednesday and slipped the siller I was not supposed to
see into a stocking-foot, she said, 'Now he's twenty and the worst of it
over.' Poor woman! she was sadly out of her reckoning. I'm thinking I have
here but a bairn of ten. You should still be at the dominie's.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was not altogether to blame, father,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;The thing was an
accident.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said he soothingly. &ldquo;Was't ever otherwise when the
devil joggled an elbow? Whatever it was, accident or design, it's a
session lost. Pack up, Paul, my very young boy, and we'll e'en make our
way quietly from this place where they may ken us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He paid the landlady her lawing, with sixpence over for her motherliness,
whereat she was ready to greet, and he took an end of my blue kist down
the stairs with me, and over with it like a common porter to the carrier's
stance.
</p>
<p>
A raw, raining day, and the rough highways over the hoof with slush of
melted snow, we were a chittering pair as we drove under the tilt of the
cart that came to the Mearns to meet us, and it was a dumb and solemn
home-coming for me.
</p>
<p>
Not that I cared much myself, for my lawyership thus cracked in the shell,
as it were I had been often seized with the notion that six feet of a
moor-lander, in a lustre gown and a horse-hair wig and a blue shalloon bag
for the fees, was a wastry of good material. But it was the dad and her at
home I thought of, and could put my neck below the cartwheel for
distressing. I knew what he thought of as he sat in the cart corner, for
many a time he had told me his plans; and now they were sadly marred. I
was to get as much as I could from the prelections of Professor Reid, work
my way through the furrows of Van Eck, Van Muyden, and the Pandects, then
go to Utrecht or Groningen for the final baking, and come back to the desk
of Coghill and Sproat, Writers to the Signet, in Spreull's Land of
Edinburgh; run errands between that dusty hole and the taverns of
Salamander Land, where old Sproat (that was my father's doer) held long
sederunts with his clients, to write a thesis finally, and graduate at the
art of making black look&mdash;not altogether white perhaps, but a kind of
dirty grey. I had been even privileged to try a sampling of the lawyer's
life before I went to college, in the chambers of MacGibbon of Lanark
town, where I spent a summer (that had been more profitably passed in my
father's fields), backing letters, fair-copying drafts of lease and
process, and indexing the letter-book. The last I hated least of all, for
I could have a half-sheet of foolscap between the pages, and under
MacGibbon's very nose try my hand at something sombre in the manner of the
old ancient ballads of the Border. Doing that same once, I gave a wild cry
and up with my inky hand and shook it. &ldquo;Eh! eh!&rdquo; cried MacGibbon, thinking
I had gone mad. &ldquo;What ails ye?&rdquo; &ldquo;He struck me with his sword!&rdquo; said I like
a fool, not altogether out of my frenzy; and then the snuffy old body came
round the corner of the desk, keeked into the letter-book where I should
have been doing his work, and saw that I was wasting good paper with
clinking trash. &ldquo;Oh, sirs! sirs! I never misused a minute of my youth in
the like of that!&rdquo; said he, sneering, and the sneer hurt. &ldquo;No, I daresay
not,&rdquo; I answered him. &ldquo;Perhaps ye never had the inclination&mdash;nor the
art.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I have gone through the world bound always to say what was in me, and that
has been my sore loss more than once; but to speak thus to an old man, who
had done me no ill beyond demonstrating the general world's attitude to
poetry and men of sentiment, was the blackest insolence. He was well
advised to send me home for a leathering at my father's hands. And I got
the leathering, too, though it was three months after. I had been off in
the interim upon a sloop ship out of Ayr.
</p>
<p>
But here I am havering, and the tilted cart with my father and me in it
toiling on the mucky way through the Meams; and it has escaped couping
into the Earn at the ford, and it has landed us at the gate of home; and
in all that weary journey never a word, good or ill, from the man that
loved me and my mother before all else in a world he was well content
with.
</p>
<p>
Mother was at the door; that daunted me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye must be fair starving, Paul,&rdquo; quoth she softly with her hand on my
arm, and I daresay my face was blae with cold and chagrin. But my father
was not to let a disgrace well merited blow over just like that.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's our little Paul, Katrine,&rdquo; said he, and me towering a head or two
above the pair of them and a black down already on my face. &ldquo;Here's our
little Paul. I hope you have not put by his bibs and daidlies, for the wee
man's not able to sup the good things of this life clean yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And that was the last word of reproof I heard for my folly from my father
Quentin Greig.

CHAPTER II
</h2>
<h3>
MISS FORTUNE'S TRYST BY WATER OF EARN, AND HOW I MARRED THE SAME
UNWITTINGLY
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or the most part of a year I toiled and moiled like any crofter's son on
my father's poor estate, and dreary was the weird I had to dree, for my
being there at all was an advertisement to the countryside of what a fool
was young Paul Greig. &ldquo;The Spoiled Horn&rdquo; was what they called me in the
neighbourhood (I learned it in the taunt of a drunken packman), for I had
failed at being the spoon I was once designed for, and there was not a
ne'er-do-weel peasant nor a bankrupt portioner came craving some benefit
to my father's door but made up for his deference to the laird by his free
manner with the laird's son. The extra tenderness of my mother (if that
were possible) only served to swell my rebel heart, for I knew she was but
seeking to put me in a better conceit of myself, and I found a place
whereof I had before been fond exceedingly assume a new complexion. The
rain seemed to fall constantly that year, and the earth in spring was
sodden and sour. Hazel Den House appeared sunk in the rotten leafage of
the winter long after the lambs came home and the snipe went drumming on
the marsh, and the rookery in the holm plantation was busy with scolding
parents tutoring their young. A solemn house at its best&mdash;it is so
yet, sometimes I think, when my wife is on a jaunt at her sister's and
Walter's bairns are bedded&mdash;it was solemn beyond all description that
spring, and little the better for the coming of summer weather. For then
the trees about it, that gave it over long billows of untimbered
countryside an aspect of dark importance, by the same token robbed it (as
I thought then) of its few amenities. How it got the name of Hazel Den I
cannot tell, for autumn never browned a nut there. It was wych elm and ash
that screened Hazel Den House; the elms monstrous and grotesque with
knotty growths: when they were in their full leaf behind the house they
hid the valley of the Clyde and the Highland hills, that at bleaker
seasons gave us a sense of companionship with the wide world beyond our
infield of stunted crops. The ash towered to the number of two score and
three towards the south, shutting us off from the view there, and working
muckle harm to our kitchen-garden. Many a time my father was for cutting
them down, but mother forbade it, though her syboes suffered from the
shade and her roses grew leggy and unblooming. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is the
want of constant love: flowers are like bairns; ye must be aye thinking of
them kindly to make them thrive.&rdquo; And indeed there might be something in
the notion, for her apple-ringie and Dutch Admiral, jonquils,
gillyflowers, and peony-roses throve marvellously, better then they did
anywhere in the shire of Renfrew while she lived and tended them and have
never been quite the same since she died, even with a paid gardener to
look after them.
</p>
<p>
A winter loud with storm, a spring with rain-rot in the fallen leaf, a
summer whose foliage but made our home more solitary than ever, a short
autumn of stifling heats&mdash;that was the year the Spoiled Horn tasted
the bitterness of life, the bitterness that comes from the want of an aim
(that is better than the best inheritance in kind) and from a
consciousness that the world mistrusts your ability. And to cap all, there
was no word about my returning to the prelections of Professor Reid, for a
reason which I could only guess at then, but learned later was simply the
want of money.
</p>
<p>
My father comported himself to me as if I were doomed to fall into a
decline, as we say, demanding my avoidance of night airs, preaching the
Horatian virtues of a calm life in the fields, checking with a reddened
face and a half-frightened accent every turn of the conversation that gave
any alluring colour to travel or adventure. Notably he was dumb, and so
was my mother, upon the history of his family. He had had four brothers:
three of them I knew were dead and their tombs not in Mearns kirkyard; one
of them, Andrew, the youngest, still lived: I feared it might be in a
bedlam, by the avoidance they made of all reference to him. I was fated,
then, for Bedlam or a galloping consumption&mdash;so I apprehended
dolefully from the mystery of my folk; and the notion sent me often
rambling solitary over the autumn moors, cultivating a not unpleasing
melancholy and often stringing stanzas of a solemn complexion that I
cannot recall nowadays but with a laugh at my folly.
</p>
<p>
A favourite walk of mine in these moods was along the Water of Earn, where
the river chattered and sang over rocks and shallows or plunged thundering
in its linn as it did ere I was born and shall do when I and my story are
forgotten. A pleasant place, and yet I nearly always had it to myself
alone.
</p>
<p>
I should have had it always to myself but for one person&mdash;Isobel
Fortune from the Kirkillstane. She seemed as little pleased to meet me
there as I was to meet her, though we had been brought up in the same
school together; and when I would come suddenly round a bend of the road
and she appeared a hundred yards off, I noticed that she half stopped and
seemed, as it were, to swither whether she should not turn and avoid me.
It would not have surprised me had she done so, for, to tell the truth, I
was no very cheery object to contemplate upon a pleasant highway, with the
bawbee frown of a poetic gloom upon my countenance and the most curt of
salutations as I passed. What she did there all her lone so often mildly
puzzled me, till I concluded she was on a tryst with some young gentleman
of the neighbourhood; but as I never saw sign of him, I did not think
myself so much the marplot as to feel bound to take another road for my
rambling. I was all the surer 'twas a lover she was out to meet, because
she reddened guiltily each time that we encountered (a fine and sudden
charm to a countenance very striking and beautiful, as I could not but
observe even then when weightier affairs engaged me); but it seemed I was
all in error, for long after she maintained she was, like myself,
indulging a sentimental humour that she found go very well in tune with
the noise of Earn Water.
</p>
<p>
As it was her habit to be busily reading when we thus met, I had little
doubt as to the ownership of a book that one afternoon I found on the road
not long after passing her. It was&mdash;of all things in the world!&mdash;Hervey's
&ldquo;Meditations.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's an odd graveyard taste for a lass of that stamp,&rdquo; thought I,
hastening back after her to restore the book, and when I came up to her
she was&mdash;not red this time, but wan to the very lips, and otherwise
in such confusion that she seemed to tremble upon her legs, &ldquo;I think this
is yours, Isobel,&rdquo; says I: we were too well acquaint from childhood for
any address more formal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Paul,&rdquo; said she hastily. &ldquo;How stupid of me to lose it!&rdquo;
 She took it from me; her eye fell (for the first time, I felt sure) upon
the title of the volume, and she bit her lip in a vexation. I was all the
more convinced that her book was but a blind in her rambles, and that
there was a lover somewhere; and I think I must have relaxed my silly
black frown a little, and my proud melancholy permitted a faint smile of
amusement. The flag came to her face then.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said she very dryly, and she left me in the middle of the
road, like a stirk. If it had been no more than that, I should have
thought it a girl's tantrum; but the wonder was to come, for before I had
taken three steps on my resumed way I heard her run after me. I stopped,
and she stopped, and the notion struck me like a rhyme of song that there
was something inexpressibly pleasant in her panting breath and her heaving
bosom, where a pebble brooch of shining red gleamed like an eye between
her breasts.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm not going to tell you a lie about it, Master Paul,&rdquo; she said, almost
like to cry; &ldquo;I let the book fall on purpose.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I could have guessed as much as that, Isobel,&rdquo; said I, wondering who
in all the world the fellow was. Her sun-bonnet had fallen from her head
in her running, and hung at her back on its pink ribbons, and a curl or
two of her hair played truant upon her cheek and temple. It seemed to me
the young gentleman she was willing to let a book drop for as a signal of
her whereabouts was lucky enough.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! you could have guessed!&rdquo; she repeated, with a tone in which were
dumbfounderment and annoyance; &ldquo;then I might have saved myself the
trouble.&rdquo; And off she went again, leaving me more the stirk than ever and
greatly struck at her remorse of conscience over a little sophistry very
pardonable in a lass caught gallivanting. When she was gone and her frock
was fluttering pink at the turn of the road, I was seized for the first
time with a notion that a girl like that some way set off, as we say, or
suited with, a fine landscape.
</p>
<p>
Not five minutes later I met young David Borland of the Driepps, and there&mdash;I
told myself&mdash;the lover was revealed! He let on he was taking a short
cut for Polnoon, so I said neither buff nor sty as to Mistress Isobel.
</p>
<p>
The cool superiority of the gentleman, who had, to tell the truth, as
little in his head as I had in the heel of my shoe, somewhat galled me,
for it cried &ldquo;Spoiled Horn!&rdquo; as loud as if the taunt were bawled, so my
talk with him was short. There was but one topic in it to interest me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has the man with the scarred brow come yet?&rdquo; he asked curiously.
</p>
<p>
I did not understand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then he's not your length yet,&rdquo; said he, with the manifest gratification
of one who has the hanselling of great news. &ldquo;Oh! I came on him this
morning outside a tavern in the Gorbals, bargaining loudly about a saddle
horse for Hazel Den. I'll warrant Hazel Den will get a start when it sees
him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I did not care to show young Borland much curiosity in his story, and so
it was just in the few words he gave it to me that I brought it home to
our supper-table.
</p>
<p>
My father and mother looked at each other as if I had told them a tragedy.
The supper ended abruptly. The evening worship passed unusually fast, my
father reading the Book as one in a dream, and we went to our beds nigh an
hour before the customary time.

CHAPTER III
</h2>
<h3>
OF THE COMING OF UNCLE ANDREW WITH A SCARRED FOREHEAD AND A BRASS-BOUND
CHEST, AND HOW I TOOK AN INFECTION
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a night&mdash;as often happens in the uplands of our shire in
autumn weather&mdash;of vast and brooding darkness: the world seemed to
swound in a breathless oven, and I had scarcely come to my chamber when
thunder broke wild upon the world and torrential rain began to fall. I did
not go to bed, but sat with my candle extinguished and watched the
lightning show the landscape as if it had been flooded by the gleam of
moon and star.
</p>
<p>
Between the roar of the thunder and the blatter of the rain there were
intervals of an astounding stillness of an ominous suspense, and it seemed
oddly to me, as I sat in my room, that more than I was awake in Hazel Den
House. I felt sure my father and mother sat in their room, still clad and
whispering; it was but the illusion of a moment&mdash;something felt by
the instinct and not by reason&mdash;and then a louder, nearer peal of
thunder dispelled the notion, and I made to go to bed.
</p>
<p>
I stopped like one shot, with my waistcoat half undone.
</p>
<p>
There was a sound of a horse's hoofs coming up the loan, with the beat of
them in mire sounding soft enough to make me shiver at the notion of the
rider's discomfort in that appalling night, and every now and then the
metal click of shoes, showing the animal over-reached himself in the trot.
</p>
<p>
The rider drew up at the front; a flash of the lightning and the wildest
thunder-peal of the night seemed to meet among our outhouses, and when the
roll of the thunder ceased I heard a violent rapping at the outer door.
</p>
<p>
The servants would be long ere they let this late visitor out of the
storm, I fancied, and I hurried down; but my father was there in the hall
before me, all dressed, as my curious intuition had informed me, and his
face strange and inscrutable in the light of a shaded candle. He was
making to open the door. My appearance seemed to startle him. He paused,
dubious and a trifle confused.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought you had been in bed long ago,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His sentence was not finished, for the horseman broke in upon it with a
masterful rataplan upon the oak, seemingly with a whip-head or a pistol
butt, and a cry, new to my ear and uncanny, rose through the beating rain.
</p>
<p>
With a sigh the most distressing I can mind of, my father seemed to
reconcile himself to some fate he would have warded off if he could. He
unbolted and threw back the door.
</p>
<p>
Our visitor threw himself in upon us as if we held the keys of paradise&mdash;a
man like a rake for lankiness, as was manifest even through the dripping
wrap-rascal that he wore; bearded cheek and chin in a fashion that must
seem fiendish in our shaven country; with a wild and angry eye, the Greig
mole black on his temple, and an old scar livid across his sunburned brow.
He threw a three-cocked hat upon the floor with a gesture of indolent
possession.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I'm damned!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;but this is a black welcome to one's poor
brother Andy,&rdquo; and scarcely looked upon my father standing with the shaded
candle in the wind. &ldquo;What's to drink? Drink, do you hear that Quentin?
Drink&mdash;drink&mdash;d-r-i-n-k. A long strong drink too, and that's
telling you, and none of the whey that I'm hearing's running through the
Greigs now, that once was a reputable family of three bottles and a rummer
to top all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whist, whist, man!&rdquo; pleaded father tremulously, all the man out of him as
he stood before this drunken apparition.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whist I quo' he. Well stap me! do you no' ken the lean pup of the
litter?&rdquo; hiccoughed our visitor, with a sort of sneer that made the blood
run to my head, and for the first time I felt the great, the splendid joy
of a good cause to fight for.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're Andrew,&rdquo; said my father simply, putting his hand upon the man's
coat sleeve in a sympathy for his drenchen clothes.
</p>
<p>
That kindly hand was jerked off rudely, an act as insolent as if he had
smitten his host upon the mouth: my heart leaped, and my fingers went at
his throat. I could have spread him out against the wall, though I knew
him now my uncle; I could have given him the rogue's quittance with a
black face and a protruding tongue. The candle fell from my father's hand;
the glass shade shattered; the hall of Hazel Den House was plunged in
darkness, and the rain drave in through the open door upon us three
struggling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let him go, Paul,&rdquo; whispered my father, who I knew was in terror of
frightening his wife, and he wrestled mightily with an arm of each of us.
</p>
<p>
Yet I could not let my uncle go, for with the other arm he held a knife,
and he would perhaps have died for it had not another light come on the
stair and my mother's voice risen in a pitiful cry.
</p>
<p>
We fell asunder on a common impulse, and the drunken wanderer was the
first to speak.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Katrine,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it's always the old tale with Andy, you see; they
must be misunderstanding me,&rdquo; and he bowed with a surprising
gentlemanliness that could have made me almost think him not the man who
had fouled our house with oaths and drawn a knife upon us in the darkness.
The blade of the same, by a trick of legerdemain, had gone up the sleeve
of his dripping coat. He seemed all at once sobered. He took my good
mother by the hand as she stood trembling and never to know clearly upon
what elements of murder she had come.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is you, Andrew,&rdquo; said she, bravely smiling. &ldquo;What a night to come home
in after twenty years! I'm wae to see you in such a plight. And your
horse?&rdquo; said she again, lifting her candle and peering into the darkness
of the night. &ldquo;I must cry up Sandy to stable your horse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I'll give my uncle the credit of a confusion at his own forgetfulness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good Lord! Katrine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I did not clean forget the brute, a
fiddle-faced, spavined, spatter-dasher of a Gorbals mare, no' worth her
corn; but there's my bit kistie on her hump.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The servant was round soon at the stabling of the mare, and my mother was
brewing something of what the gentleman had had too much already, though
she could not guess that; and out of the dripping night he dragged in none
of a rider's customary holsters but a little brass-bound chest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yon night I set out for my fortune, Quentin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I did not think I
would come back with it a bulk so small as this; did you? It was the sight
of the quiet house and the thought of all it contained that made me act
like an idiot as I came in. Still, we must just take the world as we get
it, Quentin; and I knew I was sure of a warm welcome in the old house,
from one side of it if not from the other, for the sake of lang syne. And
this is your son, is it?&rdquo; he went on, looking at my six feet of
indignation not yet dead &ldquo;Split me if there's whey in that piece! You near
jammed my hawze that time! Your Uncle Andrew's hawze, boy. Are you not
ashamed of yourself?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said I between my teeth; &ldquo;I leave that to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He smiled till his teeth shone white in his black beard, and &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; cried
he, &ldquo;I'm that glad I came. It was but the toss of a bawbee, when I came to
Leith last week, whether I should have a try at the old doocot, or up Blue
Peter again and off to the Indies. I hate ceiled rooms&mdash;they mind me
of the tomb; I'm out of practice at sitting doing nothing in a parlour and
saying grace before meat, and&mdash;I give you warning, Quentin&mdash;I'll
be damned if I drink milk for supper. It was the notion of milk for supper
and all that means that kept me from calling on Katrine&mdash;and you&mdash;any
sooner. But I'm glad I came to meet a lad of spirit like young Andy here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not Andy,&rdquo; said my father. &ldquo;Paul is his name.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
My uncle laughed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That was ill done of you, Quentin,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I think it was as little as
Katrine and you could do to have kept up the family name. I suppose you
reckoned to change the family fate when you made him Paul. H'm! You must
have forgotten that Paul the Apostle wandered most, and many ways fared
worst of all the rest. I haven't forgotten my Bible, you see, Quentin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We were now in the parlour room; a servant lass was puffing up a
new-lighted fire; my uncle, with his head in the shade, had his greatcoat
off, and stood revealed in shabby garments that had once been most
genteel; and his brass-bound fortune, that he seemed averse from parting
with a moment, was at his feet. Getting no answer to what he had said of
the disciples, he looked from one to the other of us and laughed slyly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take off your boots, Andy,&rdquo; said my father.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And where have you been since&mdash;since&mdash;the Plantations?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stow that, Quentin!&rdquo; cried my uncle, with an oath and his eye on me.
&ldquo;What Plantations are you blethering about? And where have I been? Ask me
rather where have I not been. It makes me dizzy even to think of it: with
rotten Jesuits and Pagan gentlemen; with France and Spain, and with filthy
Lascars, lying Greeks, Eboe slaves, stinking niggers, and slit-eyed
Chinese! Oh! I tell you I've seen things in twenty years. And places, too:
this Scotland, with its infernal rain and its grey fields and its rags,
looks like a nightmare to me yet. You may be sure I'll be out of it pretty
fast again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor Scotland!&rdquo; said father ambiguously.
</p>
<p>
There must be people in the world who are oddly affected by the names of
places, peoples, things that have never come within their own experience.
Till this day the name of Barbadoes influences me like a story of
adventure; and when my Uncle Andrew&mdash;lank, bearded, drenched with
storm, stood in our parlour glibly hinting at illimitable travel, I lost
my anger with the tipsy wretch and felt a curious glow go through my
being.

CHAPTER IV
</h2>
<h3>
I COME UPON THE RED SHOES
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>ncle Andrew settled for the remainder of his time into our domestic world
at Hazel Den as if his place had been kept warm for him since ever he went
away. For the remainder of his time, I say, because he was to be in the
clods of Mearns kirkyard before the hips and haws were off the hedges; and
I think I someway saw his doom in his ghastly countenance the first
morning he sat at our breakfast table, contrite over his folly of the
night before, as you could see, but carrying off the situation with
worldly <i>sang froid</i>, and even showing signs of some affection for my
father.
</p>
<p>
His character may be put in two words&mdash;he was a lovable rogue; his
tipsy bitterness to the goodman his brother may be explained almost as
briefly: he had had a notion of Katrine Oliver, and had courted her before
ever she met my father, and he had lost her affection through his own
folly. Judging from what I would have felt myself in the like
circumstances, his bitterest punishment for a life ill spent must have
been to see Katrine Oliver's pitying kindness to him now, and the sight of
that douce and loving couple finding their happiness in each other must
have been a constant sermon to him upon repentance.
</p>
<p>
Yet, to tell the truth, I fear my Uncle Andrew was not constituted for
repentance or remorse. He had slain a man honestly once, and had suffered
the Plantations, but beyond that (and even that included, as he must ever
insist) he had been guilty of no mean act in all his roving career.
Follies&mdash;vices&mdash;extremes&mdash;ay, a thousand of them; but for
most his conscience never pricked him. On the contrary, he would narrate
with gusto the manifold jeopardies his own follies brought him into; his
wan face, nigh the colour of a shroud, would flush, and his eyes dance
humorously as he shocked the table when we sat at meals, our spoons
suspended in the agitation created by his wonderful histories.
</p>
<p>
Kept to a moderation with the bottle, and with the constant influence of
my mother, who used to feed the rogue on vegetables and, unknown to him,
load his broth with simples as a cure for his craving, Uncle Andrew was,
all things considered, an acquisition to Hazel Den House. Speaking for
myself, he brought the element of the unusual and the unexpected to a
place where routine had made me sick of my own society; and though the man
in his sober senses knew he was dying on his feet, he was the cheeriest
person of our company sequestered so remote in the moors. It was a lesson
in resignation to see yon merry eyes loweing like lamps over his tombstone
cheeks, and hear him crack a joke in the flushed and heaving interludes of
his cough.
</p>
<p>
It was to me he ever directed the most sensational of his extraordinary
memorials. My father did not like it; I saw it in his eye. It was apparent
to me that a remonstrance often hung on the tip of his tongue. He would
invent ridiculous and unnecessary tasks to keep me out of reach of that
alluring <i>raconteur</i>, and nobody saw it plainer than Uncle Andrew,
who but laughed with the mischievousness of a boy.
</p>
<p>
Well, the long and short of it was just what Quentin Greig feared&mdash;the
Spoiled Horn finally smit with a hunger for the road of the Greigs. For
three hundred years&mdash;we could go no further back, because of a bend
sinister&mdash;nine out of ten of that family had travelled that road,
that leads so often to a kistful of sailor's shells and a death with boots
on. It was a fate in the blood, like the black hair of us, the mole on the
temple, and the trick of irony. It was that ailment my father had feared
for me; it was that kept the household silent upon missing brothers (they
were dead, my uncle told me, in Trincomalee, and in Jamaica, and a yard in
the Borough of London); it was that inspired the notion of a lawyer's life
for Paul Greig.
</p>
<p>
Just when I was in the deepmost confidence of Uncle Andrew, who was by
then confined to his bed and suffering the treatment of Doctor Clews, his
stories stopped abruptly and he began to lament the wastry of his life. If
the thing had been better acted I might have been impressed, for our
follies never look just like what they are till we are finally on the
broad of our backs and the Fell Sergeant's step is at the door. But it was
not well acted; and when the wicked Uncle Andrew groaned over the very
ploys he had a week ago exulted in, I recognised some of my mother's
commonest sentiments in his sideways sermon. She had got her quondam Andy,
for lang syne's sake, to help her keep her son at home; and he was doing
his best, poor man, but a trifle late in the day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Uncle Andrew,&rdquo; said I, never heeding his homily, &ldquo;tell me what came of
the pock-marked tobacco planter when you and the negro lay in the swamp
for him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He groaned hopelessly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A rotten tale, Paul, my lad,&rdquo; said he, never looking me in the face; &ldquo;I
rue the day I was mixed up in that affair.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it was a good story so far as it went, no further gone than Wednesday
last,&rdquo; I protested.
</p>
<p>
He laughed at that, and for half an hour he put off the new man of my
mother's bidding, and we were on the old naughty footing again. He
concluded by bequeathing to me for the twentieth time the brass-bound
chest, and its contents that we had never seen nor could guess the nature
of. But now for the first time he let me know what I might expect there.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's not what Quentin might consider much,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for there's not a
guelder of money in it, no, nor so little as a groat, for as the world's
divided ye can't have both the money and the dance, and I was aye the
fellow for the dance. There's scarcely anything in it, Paul, but the trash&mdash;ahem!&mdash;that
is the very fitting reward of a life like mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And still and on, uncle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is a very good tale about the
pock-marked man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! You're there, Greig!&rdquo; cried the rogue, laughing till his hoast came
to nigh choke him. &ldquo;Well, the kist's yours, anyway, such as it is; and
there's but one thing in it&mdash;to be strict, a pair&mdash;that I set
any store by as worth leaving to my nephew.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It ought to be spurs,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to drive me out of this lamentable
countryside and to where a fellow might be doing something worth while.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you're no' so far off it, for it's a pair of shoes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A pair of shoes!&rdquo; I repeated, half inclined to think that Uncle Andrew
was doited at last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A pair of shoes, and perhaps in some need of the cobbler, for I have worn
them a good deal since I got them in Madras. They were not new when I got
them, but by the look of them they're not a day older now. They have got
me out of some unco' plights in different parts of the world, for all that
the man who sold them to me at a bonny penny called them the Shoes of
Sorrow; and so far as I ken, the virtue's in them yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A doomed man's whim,&rdquo; thought I, and professed myself vastly gratified by
his gift.
</p>
<p>
He died next morning. It was Candlemas Day. He went out at last like a
crusie wanting oil. In the morning he had sat up in bed to sup porridge
that, following a practice I had made before his reminiscences concluded,
I had taken in to him myself. Tremendous long and lean the upper part of
him looked, and the cicatrice upon his brow made his ghastliness the more
appalling. When he sat against the bolsters he could see through the
window into the holm field, and, as it happened, what was there but a wild
young roe-deer driven down from some higher part of the country by stress
of winter weather, and a couple of mongrel dogs keeping him at bay in an
angle of the fail dyke.
</p>
<p>
I have seldom seen a man more vastly moved than Uncle Andrew looking upon
this tragedy of the wilds. He gasped as though his chest would crack, a
sweat burst on his face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's&mdash;that's the end o't, Paul, my lad!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yonder's your
roving uncle, and the tykes have got him cornered at last. No more the
heather and the brae; no more&mdash;no more&mdash;no more&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Such a change came on him that I ran and cried my mother ben, and she and
father were soon at his bedside.
</p>
<p>
It was to her he turned his eyes, that had seen so much of the spacious
world of men and women and all their multifarious interests, great and
little. They shone with a light of memory and affection, so that I got
there and then a glimpse of the Uncle Andrew of innocence and the Uncle
Andrew who might have been if fate had had it otherwise.
</p>
<p>
He put out his hand and took hers, and said goodbye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The hounds have me, Katrine,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm at the fail dyke corner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll go out and whistle them off, uncle,&rdquo; said I, fancying it all a
doited man's illusion, though the look of death was on him; but I stood
rebuked in the frank gaze he gave me of a fuller comprehension than mine,
though he answered me not.
</p>
<p>
And then he took my father's hand in his other, and to him too he said
farewell.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're there, Quentin!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and Katrine&mdash;Katrine&mdash;Katrine
chose by far the better man. God be merciful to poor Andy Greig, a
sinner.&rdquo; And these were his last words.

A SPOILED TRYST, AND OTHER THINGS THAT FOLLOWED ON THE OPENING OF THE
CHEST
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he funeral was over before I cared to examine my bequest, and then I went
to it with some reluctance, for if a pair of shoes was the chief contents
of the brass-bound chest, there was like to be little else except the
melancholy relics of a botched life. It lay where he left it on the night
he came&mdash;under the foot of his bed&mdash;and when I lifted the lid I
felt as if I was spying upon a man through a keyhole. Yet, when I came
more minutely to examine the contents, I was disappointed that at the
first reflection nothing was there half so pregnant as his own most casual
tale to rouse in me the pleasant excitation of romance.

<p>
A bairn's caul&mdash;that sailor's trophy that has kept many a mariner
from drowning only that he might die a less pleasant death; a broken
handcuff, whose meaning I cared not to guess at; a pop or pistol; a
chap-book of country ballads, that possibly solaced his exile from the
land they were mostly written about; the batters of a Bible, with nothing
between them but his name in his mother's hand on the inside of the board;
a traveller's log or itinerary, covering a period of fifteen years,
extremely minute in its detail and well written; a broken sixpence and the
pair of shoes.
</p>
<p>
The broken sixpence moved my mother to tears, for she had had the other
half twenty years ago, before Andrew Greig grew ne'er-do-weel; the shoes
failed to rouse in her or in my father any interest whatever. If they
could have guessed it, they would have taken them there and then and sunk
them in the deepest linn of Earn.
</p>
<p>
There was little kenspeckle about them saving their colour, which was a
dull dark red. They were of the most excellent material, with a great deal
of fine sewing thrown away upon them in parts where it seems to me their
endurance was in no wise benefited, and an odd pair of silver buckles gave
at your second glance a foreign look to them.
</p>
<p>
I put them on at the first opportunity: they fitted me as if my feet had
been moulded to them, and I sat down to the study of the log-book. The
afternoon passed, the dusk came. I lit a candle, and at midnight, when I
reached the year of my uncle's escape from the Jesuits of Spain, I came to
myself gasping, to find the house in an alarm, and that lanthorns were out
about Earn Water looking for me, while all the time I was <i>perdu</i> in
the dead uncle's chamber in the baron's wing, as we called it, of Hazel
Den House. I pretended I had fallen asleep; it was the first and the last
time I lied to my mother, and something told me she knew I was deceiving
her. She looked at the red shoes on my feet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ugly brogues!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it's a wonder to me you would put them on your
feet. You don't know who has worn them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They were Uncle Andy's,&rdquo; said I, complacently looking at them, for they
fitted like a glove; the colour was hardly noticeable in the evening, and
the buckles were most becoming.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay! and many a one before him, I'm sure,&rdquo; said she, with distaste in her
tone, &ldquo;I don't think them nice at all, Paul,&rdquo; and she shuddered a little.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's but a freit,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but it's not likely I'll wear much of such
a legacy.&rdquo; I went up and left them in the chest, and took the diary into
my own room and read Uncle Andrew's marvellous adventures in the trade of
rover till it was broad daylight.
</p>
<p>
When I had come to the conclusion it seemed as if I had been in the
delirium of a fever, so tempestuous and unreal was that memoir of a wild
loose life. The sea was there, buffeting among the pages in rollers and
breakers; there were the chronicles of a hundred ports, with boozing kens
and raving lazarettos in them; far out isles and cays in nameless oceans,
and dozing lagoons below tropic skies; a great clash of weapons and a
bewildering deal of political intrigue in every part of the Continent from
Calais to Constantinople. My uncle's narrative in life had not hinted at
one half the marvel of his career, and I read his pages with a rapture, as
one hears a noble piece of music, fascinated to the uttermost, and finding
no moral at the end beyond that the world we most of us live in with
innocence and ignorance is a crust over tremendous depths. And then I
burned the book. It went up in a grey smoke on the top of the fire that I
had kept going all night for its perusal; and the thing was no sooner done
than I regretted it, though the act was dictated by the seemly enough idea
that its contents would only distress my parents if they came to their
knowledge.
</p>
<p>
For days&mdash;for weeks&mdash;for a season&mdash;I went about, my head
humming with Uncle Andy's voice recounting the most stirring of his
adventures as narrated in the log-book. I had been infected by almost his
first words the night he came to Hazel Den House, and made a magic chant
of the mere names of foreign peoples; now I was fevered indeed; and when I
put on the red shoes (as I did of an evening, impelled by some dandyism
foreign to my nature hitherto), they were like the seven-league boots for
magic, as they set my imagination into every harbour Uncle Andy had
frequented and made me a guest at every inn where he had met his boon
companions.
</p>
<p>
I was wearing them the next time I went on my excursion to Earn side and
there met Isobel Fortune, who had kept away from the place since I had
smiled at my discovery of her tryst with Hervey's &ldquo;Meditations.&rdquo; She came
upon me unexpectedly, when the gentility of my shoes and the recollection
of all that they had borne of manliness was making me walk along the road
with a very high head and an unusually jaunty step.
</p>
<p>
She seemed struck as she came near, with her face displaying her
confusion, and it seemed to me she was a new woman altogether&mdash;at
least, not the Isobel I had been at school with and seen with an
indifferent eye grow up like myself from pinafores. It seemed suddenly
scandalous that the like of her should have any correspondence with so
ill-suited a lover as David Borland of the Dreipps.
</p>
<p>
For the first time (except for the unhappy introduction of Hervey's
&ldquo;Meditations&rdquo;) we stopped to speak to each other. She was the most
bewitching mixture of smiles and blushes, and stammering now and then, and
vastly eager to be pleasant to me, and thinks I, &ldquo;My lass, you're keen on
trysting when it's with Borland.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The very thought of the fellow in that connection made me angry in her
interest; and with a mischievous intention of spoiling his sport if he
hovered, as I fancied, in the neighbourhood, or at least of delaying his
happiness as long as I could, I kept the conversation going very blithe
indeed.
</p>
<p>
She had a laugh, low and brief, and above all sincere, which is the great
thing in laughter, that was more pleasant to hear than the sound of Earn
in its tinkling hollow among the ferns: it surprised me that she should
favour my studied and stupid jocosities with it so frequently. Here was
appreciation! I took, in twenty minutes, a better conceit of myself, than
the folks at home could have given me in the twelve months since I left
the college, and I'll swear to this date 'twas the consciousness of my
fancy shoes that put me in such good key.
</p>
<p>
She saw my glance to them at last complacently, and pretended herself to
notice them for the first time.
</p>
<p>
She smiled&mdash;little hollows came near the corners of her lips; of a
sudden I minded having once kissed Mistress Grant's niece in a stair-head
frolic in Glasgow High Street, and the experience had been pleasant
enough.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They're very nice,&rdquo; said Isobel.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They're all that,&rdquo; said I, gazing boldly at her dimples. She flushed and
drew in her lips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I cried, &rdquo;'twas not them I was thinking of; but their neighbours.
I never saw you had dimples before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At that she was redder than ever.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could not help that, Paul,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;they have been always there, and
you are getting very audacious. I was thinking of your new shoes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you know they're new?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could tell,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;by the sound of your footstep before you came
in sight.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It might not have been my footstep,&rdquo; said I, and at that she was taken
back.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said she, hasty to correct herself. &ldquo;I only thought it
might be your footstep, as you are often this way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It might as readily have been David Borland's. I have seen him about
here.&rdquo; I watched her as closely as I dared: had her face changed, I would
have felt it like a blow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anyway, they're very nice, your new shoes,&rdquo; said she, with a marvellous
composure that betrayed nothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They were uncle's legacy,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;and had travelled far in many
ways about the world; far&mdash;and fast.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And still they don't seem to be in such a hurry as your old ones,&rdquo; said
she, with a mischievous air. Then she hastened to cover what might seem a
rudeness. &ldquo;Indeed, they're very handsome, Paul, and become you very much,
and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They're called the Shoes of Sorrow; that's the name my uncle had for
them,&rdquo; said I, to help her to her own relief.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, and I hope it may be no more than a by-name,&rdquo; she said gravely.
</p>
<p>
The day had the first rumour of spring: green shoots thrust among the bare
bushes on the river side, and the smell of new turned soil came from a
field where a plough had been feiring; above us the sky was blue, in the
north the land was pleasantly curved against silver clouds.
</p>
<p>
And one small bird began to pipe in a clump of willows, that showered a
dust of gold upon us when the little breeze came among the branches. I
looked at all and I looked at Isobel Fortune, so trim and bonny, and it
seemed there and then good to be a man and my fortunes all to try.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorrow here or sorrow there, Isobel,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;they are the shoes to take
me away sooner or later from Hazel Den.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She caught my meaning with astounding quickness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you in earnest?&rdquo; she asked soberly, and I thought she could not have
been more vexed had it been David Borland.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Another year of this.&rdquo; said I, looking at the vacant land, &ldquo;would break
my heart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, Paul, and I thought Earn-side was never so sweet as now,&rdquo; said
she, vexed like, as if she was defending a companion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is true, too,&rdquo; said I, smiling into the very depths of her large
dark eyes, where I saw a pair of Spoiled Horns as plainly as if I looked
in sunny weather into Linn of Earn. &ldquo;That is true, too. I have never been
better pleased with it than to-day. But what in the world's to keep me?
It's all bye with the college&mdash;at which I'm but middling well
pleased; it's all bye with the law&mdash;for which thanks to Heaven! and,
though they seem to think otherwise at Hazel Den House, I don't believe
I've the cut of a man to spend his life among rowting cattle and dour clay
land.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I daresay not; it's true,&rdquo; said she stammeringly, with one fast glance
that saw me from the buckles of my red shoes to the underlids of my eyes.
For some reason or other she refused to look higher, and the distant
landscape seemed to have charmed her after that. She drummed with a toe
upon the path; she bit her nether lip; upon my word, the lass had tears at
her eyes! I had, plainly, kept her long enough from her lover. &ldquo;Well, it's
a fine evening; I must be going,&rdquo; said I stupidly, making a show at
parting, and an ugly sense of annoyance with David Borland stirring in my
heart. &ldquo;But it will rain before morning,&rdquo; said she, making to go too, but
always looking to the hump of Dungoyne that bars the way to the Hielands.
&ldquo;I think, after all, Master Paul, I liked the old shoon better than the
new ones.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you say so?&rdquo; I asked, astonished at the irrelevance that came rapidly
from her lips, as if she must cry it out or choke. &ldquo;And how comes that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just because&mdash;&rdquo; said she, and never a word more, like a woman, nor
fair good-e'en nor fair good-day to ye, but off she went, and I was the
stirk again.
</p>
<p>
I looked after her till she went out of sight, wondering what had been the
cause of her tirravee. She fair ran at the last, as if eager to get out of
my sight; and when she disappeared over the brae that rose from the
river-side there was a sense of deprivation within me. I was clean gone in
love and over the lugs in it with Isobel Fortune.

CHAPTER VI
</h2>
<h3>
MY DEED ON THE MOOR OF MEARNS
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ext day I shot David Borland of the Driepps.
</p>
<p>
It was the seventh of March, the first day I heard the laverock that
season, and it sang like to burst its heart above the spot where the lad
fell with a cry among the rushes. It rose from somewhere in our
neighbourhood, aspiring to the heavens, but chained to earth by its own
song; and even yet I can recall the eerie influence of that strange
conjunction of sin and song as I stood knee-deep in the tangle of the moor
with the pistol smoking in my hand.
</p>
<p>
To go up to the victim of my jealousy as he lay ungainly on the ground,
his writhing over, was an ordeal I could not face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Davie, Davie!&rdquo; I cried to him over the thirty paces; but I got no reply
from yon among the rushes. I tried to wet my cracking lips with a tongue
like a cork, and &ldquo;Davie, oh, Davie, are ye badly hurt?&rdquo; I cried, in a
voice I must have borrowed from ancient time when my forefathers fought
with the forest terrors.
</p>
<p>
I listened and I better listened, but Borland still lay there at last, a
thing insensate like a gangrel's pack, and in all the dreary land there
was nothing living but the laverock and me.
</p>
<p>
The bird was high&mdash;a spot upon the blue; his song, I am sure, was the
song of his kind, that has charmed lovers in summer fields from old time&mdash;a
melody rapturous, a message like the message of the evening star that God
no more fondly loves than that small warbler in desert places&mdash;and
yet there and then it deaved me like a cry from hell. No heavenly message
had the lark for me: he flew aloft there into the invisible, to tell of
this deed of mine among the rushes. Not God alone would hear him tell his
story: they might hear it, I knew, in shepherds' cots; they might hear it
in an old house bowered dark among trees; the solitary witness of my crime
might spread the hue and cry about the shire; already the law might be on
the road for young Paul Greig.
</p>
<p>
I seemed to listen a thousand years to that telltale in the air; for a
thousand years I scanned the blue for him in vain, yet when I looked at my
pistol again the barrel was still warm.
</p>
<p>
It was the first time I had handled such a weapon.
</p>
<p>
A senseless tool it seemed, and yet the crooking of a finger made it the
confederate of hate; though it, with its duty done, relapsed into a
heedless silence, I, that owned it for my instrument, must be wailing in
my breast, torn head to foot with thunders of remorse.
</p>
<p>
I raised the hammer, ran a thumb along the flint, seeing something
fiendish in the jaws that held it; I lifted up the prime-cap, and it
seemed some miracle of Satan that the dust I had put there in the peace of
my room that morning in Hazel Den should have disappeared. &ldquo;Truefitt&rdquo; on
the lock; a silver shield and an initial graven on it; a butt with a
dragon's grin that had seemed ridiculous before, and now seemed to cry
&ldquo;Cain!&rdquo; Lord! that an instrument like this in an unpractised hand should
cut off all young Borland's earthly task, end his toil with plough and
harrow, his laugh and story.
</p>
<p>
I looked again at the shapeless thing at thirty paces. &ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; I
told myself; and I cried again, in the Scots that must make him cease his
joke, &ldquo;I ken ye're only lettin' on, Davie. Get up oot o' that and we'll
cry quits.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But there was no movement; there was no sound; the tell-tale had the
heavens to himself.
</p>
<p>
All the poltroon in me came a-top and dragged my better man round about,
let fall the pistol from my nerveless fingers and drove me away from that
place. It was not the gallows I thought of (though that too was sometimes
in my mind), but of the frightful responsibility I had made my burden, to
send a human man before his Maker without a preparation, and my bullet
hole upon his brow or breast, to tell for ever through the roaring ring of
all eternity that this was the work of Paul Greig. The rushes of the moor
hissed me as I ran blindly through them; the tufts of heather over Whiggit
Knowe caught at me to stop me; the laverock seemed to follow overhead, a
sergeant of provost determined on his victim.
</p>
<p>
My feet took me, not home to the home that was mine no more, but to
Earn-side, where I felt the water crying in its linn would drown the sound
of the noisy laverock; and the familiar scene would blot for a space the
ugly sight from my eyes. I leant at the side to lave my brow, and could
scarce believe that this haggard countenance I saw look up at me from the
innocent waters was the Spoiled Horn who had been reflected in Isobel's
eyes. Over and over again I wet my lips and bathed my temples; I washed my
hands, and there was on the right forefinger a mark I bear to this day
where the trigger guard of the pistol in the moments of my agony had cut
me to the bone without my knowing it.
</p>
<p>
When my face looked less like clay and my plans were clear, I rose and
went home.
</p>
<p>
My father and mother were just sitting to supper, and I joined them. They
talked of a cousin to be married in Drymen at Michaelmas, of an income in
the leg of our mare, of Sabbath's sermon, of things that were as far from
me as I from heaven, and I heard them as one in a dream, far-off. What I
was hearing most of the time was the laverock setting the hue and cry of
Paul Greig's crime around the world and up to the Throne itself, and what
I was seeing was the vacant moor, now in the dusk, and a lad's remains
awaiting their discovery. The victuals choked me as I pretended to eat; my
father noticed nothing, my mother gave a glance, and a fright was in her
face.
</p>
<p>
I went up to my room and searched a desk for some verses that had been
gathering there in my twelve months' degradation, and particularly for one
no more than a day old with Isobel Fortune for its theme. It was all bye
with that! I was bound to be glancing at some of the lines as I furiously
tore them up and threw them out of the window into the bleaching-green;
and oh! but the black sorrows and glooms that were there recorded seemed a
mockery in the light of this my terrible experience. They went by the
window, every scrap: then I felt cut off from every innocent day of my
youth, the past clean gone from me for ever.
</p>
<p>
The evening worship came.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost ends of
the sea.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
My father, peering close at the Book through his spectacles, gave out the
words as if he stood upon a pulpit, deliberate&mdash;too deliberate for
Cain his son, that sat with his back to the window shading his face from a
mother's eyes. They were always on me, her eyes, throughout that last
service; they searched me like a torch in a pit, and wae, wae was her
face!
</p>
<p>
When we came to pray and knelt upon the floor, I felt as through my shut
eyes that hers were on me even then, exceeding sad and troubled. They
followed me like that when I went up, as they were to think, to my bed,
and I was sitting at my window in the dark half an hour later when she
came up after me. She had never done the like before since I was a child.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are ye bedded, Paul?&rdquo; she whispered in the dark.
</p>
<p>
I could not answer her in words, but I stood to my feet and lit a candle,
and she saw that I was dressed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What ails ye to-night?&rdquo; she asked trembling. &ldquo;I'm going away, mother,&rdquo; I
answered. &ldquo;There's something wrong?&rdquo; she queried in great distress.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's all that!&rdquo; I confessed. &ldquo;It'll be time for you to ken about that
in the morning, but I must be off this night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Paul, Paul!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I did not like to see you going out in these
shoes this afternoon, and I ken't that something ailed ye.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The road to hell suits one shoe as well's another,&rdquo; said I bitterly;
&ldquo;where the sorrow lies is that ye never saw me go out with a different
heart. Mother, mother, the worst ye can guess is no' so bad as the worst
ye've yet to hear of your son.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was in a storm of roaring emotions, yet her next words startled me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's Isobel Fortune of the Kirkillstane,&rdquo; she said, trying hard to smile
with a wan face in the candle light.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It <i>was</i>&mdash;poor dear! Am I not in torment when I think that she
must know it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was that that ailed ye, Paul,&rdquo; said she, as if she were
relieved. &ldquo;Look; I got this a little ago on the bleaching-green&mdash;this
scrap of paper in your write and her name upon it. Maybe I should not have
read it.&rdquo; And she handed me part of that ardent ballad I had torn less
than an hour ago.
</p>
<p>
I held it in the flame of her candle till it was gone, our hands all
trembling, and &ldquo;That's the end appointed for Paul Greig,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Paul, Paul, it cannot be so unco'!&rdquo; she cried in terror, and clutched
me at the arm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is&mdash;it is the worst.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;you're my son, Paul. Tell me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She looked so like a reed in the winter wind, so frail and little and
shivering in my room, that I dared not tell her there and then. I said it
was better that both father and she should hear my tale together, and we
went into the room where already he was bedded but not asleep. He sat up
staring at our entry, a night-cowl tassel dangling on his brow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's a man dead&mdash;&rdquo; I began, when he checked me with a shout.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; he cried, and put my mother in a chair. &ldquo;I have heard the
tale before with my brother Andy, and the end was not for women's ears.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must know, Quentin,&rdquo; said his wife, blanched to the lip but determined,
and then he put his arm about her waist. It seemed like a second murder to
wrench those tender hearts that loved me, but the thing was bound to do.
</p>
<p>
I poured out my tale at one breath and in one sentence, and when it ended
my mother was in her swound.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Paul!&rdquo; cried the poor man, his face like a clout; &ldquo;black was the day
she gave you birth!&rdquo;
 </p>

CHAPTER VII
</h2>
<h3>
QUENTIN GREIG LOSES A SON, AND I SET OUT WITH A HORSE AS ALL MY FORTUNE
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e pushed me from the chamber as I had been a stranger intruding, and I
went to the trance door and looked out at the stretching moorlands lit by
an enormous moon that rose over Cathkin Braes, and an immensity of stars.
For the first time in all my life I realised the heedlessness of nature in
human affairs the most momentous. For the moon swung up serene beyond
expression; the stars winked merrily: a late bird glid among the bushes
and perched momentarily on a bough of ash to pipe briefly almost with the
passion of the spring. But not the heedlessness of nature influenced me so
much as the barren prospect of the world that the moon and stars revealed.
There was no one out there in those deep spaces of darkness I could claim
as friend or familiar. Where was I to go? What was I to do? Only the
beginnings of schemes came to me&mdash;schemes of concealment and
disguise, of surrender even&mdash;but the last to be dismissed as soon as
it occurred to me, for how could I leave this house the bitter bequest of
a memory of the gallows-tree?
</p>
<p>
Only the beginnings, I say, for every scheme ran tilt against the obvious
truth that I was not only without affection or regard out there, but
without as much as a crown of money to purchase the semblance of either.
</p>
<p>
I could not have stood very long there when my father came out, his face
like clay, and aged miraculously, and beckoned me to the parlour.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your mother&mdash;my wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is very ill, and I am sending for
the doctor. The horse is yoking. There is another woman in Driepps who&mdash;God
help her!&mdash;will be no better this night, but I wish in truth her case
was ours, and that it was you who lay among the heather.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He began pacing up and down the floor, his eyes bent, his hands
continually wringing, his heart bursting, as it were, with sighs and the
dry sobs of the utmost wretchedness. As for me, I must have been clean
gyte (as the saying goes), for my attention was mostly taken up with the
tassel of his nightcap that bobbed grotesquely on his brow. I had not seen
it since, as a child, I used to share his room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! what!&rdquo; he cried at last piteously, &ldquo;have ye never a word to say?
Are ye dumb?&rdquo; He ran at me and caught me by the collar of the coat and
tried to shake me in an anger, but I felt it no more than I had been a
stone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What did ye do it for? What in heaven's name did ye quarrel on?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was&mdash;it was about a girl,&rdquo; I said, reddening even at that
momentous hour to speak of such a thing to him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A girl!&rdquo; he repeated, tossing up his hands. &ldquo;Keep us! Hoo lang are ye oot
o' daidlies? Well! well!&rdquo; he went on, subduing himself and prepared to
listen. I wished the tassel had been any other colour than crimson, and
hung fairer on the middle of his forehead; it seemed to fascinate me. And
he, belike, forgot that I was there, for he thought, I knew, continually
of his wife, and he would stop his feverish pacing on the floor, and
hearken for a sound from the room where she was quartered with the maid. I
made no answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; he cried again fiercely, turning upon me. &ldquo;Out with it; out
with the whole hellish transaction, man!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And then I told him in detail what before my mother I had told in a brief
abstract.
</p>
<p>
How that I had met young Borland coming down the breast of the brae at
Kirkillstane last night and&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Last night!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Are ye havering? I saw ye go to your bed at ten,
and your boots were in the kitchen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was so, I confessed. I had gone to my room but not to bed, and had
slipped out by the window when the house was still, with Uncle Andrew's
shoes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, lad!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it's Andy's shoes you stand in sure enough, for I
have seen him twenty years syne in the plight that you are in this night.
Merciful heaven! what dark blotch is in the history of this family of ours
that it must ever be embroiled in crimes of passion and come continually
to broken ends of fortune? I have lived stark honest and humble, fearing
the Lord; the covenants have I kept, and still and on it seems I must
beget a child of the Evil One!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And how, going out thus under cover of night, I had meant to indulge a
boyish fancy by seeing the light of Isobel Fortune's window. And how,
coming to the Kirkillstane, I met David Borland leaving the house,
whistling cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Paul, Paul!&rdquo; cried my father, &ldquo;I mind of you an infant on her knees
that's ben there, and it might have been but yesterday your greeting in
the night wakened me to mourn and ponder on your fate.&rdquo; And how Borland,
divining my object there, and himself new out triumphant from that
cheerful house of many daughters, made his contempt for the Spoiled Horn
too apparent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You walked to the trough-stane when you were a twelvemonth old,&rdquo; said my
father with the irrelevance of great grief, as if he recalled a dead son's
infancy.
</p>
<p>
And how, maddened by some irony of mine, he had struck a blow upon my
chest, and so brought my challenge to something more serious and
gentlemanly than a squalid brawl with fists upon the highway.
</p>
<p>
I stopped my story; it seemed useless to be telling it to one so much
preoccupied with the thought of the woman he loved. His lips were open,
his eyes were constant on the door.
</p>
<p>
But &ldquo;Well! Well!&rdquo; he cried again eagerly, and I resumed.
</p>
<p>
Of how I had come home, and crept into my guilty chamber and lay the long
night through, torn by grief and anger, jealousy and distress. And how
evading the others of the household as best I could that day, I had in the
afternoon at the hour appointed gone out with Uncle Andrew's pistol.
</p>
<p>
My father moaned&mdash;a waefu' sound!
</p>
<p>
And found young Borland up on the moor before me with such another weapon,
his face red byordinary, his hands and voice trembling with passion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor lad, poor lad!&rdquo; my father cried blurting the sentiment as he had
been a bairn.
</p>
<p>
How we tossed a coin to decide which should be the first to fire, and
Borland had won the toss, and gone to the other end of our twenty paces
with vulgar menaces and &ldquo;Spoiled Horn&rdquo; the sweetest of his epithets.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor lad! he but tried to bluster down the inward voice that told him the
folly o't,&rdquo; said father.
</p>
<p>
And how Borland had fired first. The air was damp. The sound was like a
slamming door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The door of hope shut up for him, poor dear,&rdquo; cried father.
</p>
<p>
And how he missed me in his trepidation that made his hand that held the
pistol so tremble that I saw the muzzle quiver even at twenty paces.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then you shot him deliberately I M cried my father.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I cried at that, indignant. &ldquo;I aimed without a glance along the
barrel: the flint flashed; the prime missed fire, and I was not sorry, but
Borland cried 'Spoiled Horn' braggingly, and I cocked again as fast as I
could, and blindly jerked the trigger. I never thought of striking him. He
fell with one loud cry among the rushes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Murder, by God!&rdquo; cried my father, and he relapsed into a chair, his body
all convulsed with horror.
</p>
<p>
I had told him all this as if I had been in a delirium, or as if it were a
tale out of a book, and it was only when I saw him writhing in his chair
and the tassel shaking over his eyes, I minded that the murderer was me. I
made for the door; up rose my father quickly and asked me what I meant to
do.
</p>
<p>
I confessed I neither knew nor cared.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must thole your assize,&rdquo; said he, and just as he said it the clatter
of the mare's hoofs sounded on the causey of the yard, and he must have
minded suddenly for what object she was saddled there.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must flee the country. What right have you to make
it any worse for her?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have not a crown in my pocket,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I have less,&rdquo; he answered quickly. &ldquo;Where are you going? No, no,
don't tell me that; I'm not to know. There's the mare saddled, I meant
Sandy to send the doctor from the Mearns, but you can do that. Bid him
come here as fast as he can.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And must I come back with the mare?&rdquo; I asked, reckless what he might say
to that, though my life depended on it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;For the sake of your mother,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I would rather never set eyes
on you or the beast again; she's the last transaction between us, Paul
Greig.&rdquo; And then he burst in tears, with his arms about my neck.
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />

<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/067.jpg" alt="067 (146K)" width="100%" /><br />
</div>
<p>
Ten minutes later I was on the mare, and galloping, for all her ailing
leg, from Hazel Den as if it were my own loweing conscience. I roused Dr.
Clews at the Mearns, and gave him my father's message. &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said he,
holding his chamber light up to my face, &ldquo;man, ye're as gash as a ghaist
yersel'.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I may well be that,&rdquo; said I, and off I set, with some of Uncle Andy's old
experience in my mind, upon a ride across broad Scotland.

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII
</h2>
<h3>
I RIDE BY NIGHT ACROSS SCOTLAND, AND MEET A MARINER WITH A GLEED EYE
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat night was like the day, with a full moon shining. The next afternoon
I rode into Borrowstounness, my horse done out and myself sore from head
to heel; and never in all my life have I seen a place with a more
unwelcome aspect, for the streets were over the hoof in mud; the natives
directed me in an accent like a tinker's whine; the Firth of Forth was
wrapped in a haar or fog that too closely put me in mind of my prospects.
But I had no right to be too particular, and in the course of an hour I
had sold the mare for five pounds to a man of much Christian profession,
who would not give a farthing more on the plea that she was likely stolen.
</p>
<p>
The five pounds and the clothes I stood in were my fortune: it did not
seem very much, if it was to take me out of the reach of the long arm of
the doomster; and thinking of the doomster I minded of the mole upon my
brow, that was the most kenspeckle thing about me in the event of a
description going about the country, so the first thing I bought with my
fortune was a pair of scissors. Going into a pend close in one of the
vennels beside the quay, I clipped off the hair upon the mole and felt a
little safer. I was coming out of the close, pouching the scissors, when a
man of sea-going aspect, with high boots and a tarpaulin hat, stumbled
against me and damned my awkwardness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You filthy hog,&rdquo; said I, exasperated at such manners, for he was himself
to blame for the encounter; &ldquo;how dare you speak to me like that?&rdquo; He was a
man of the middle height, sturdy on his bowed legs in spite of the drink
obvious in his face and speech, and he had a roving gleed black eye. I had
never clapped gaze on him in all my life before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that the way ye speak to Dan Risk, ye swab?&rdquo; said he, ludicrously
affecting a dignity that ill suited with his hiccough. &ldquo;What's the good of
me being a skipper if every linen-draper out of Fife can cut into my
quarter on my own deck?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is no' your quarter-deck, man, if ye were sober enough to ken it,&rdquo;
 said I; &ldquo;and I'm no linen-draper from Fife or anywhere else.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And then the brute, with his hands thrust to the depth of his pockets,
staggered me as if he had done it with a blow of his fist.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, with a very cunning tone, &ldquo;ye're no linen-draper perhaps,
but&mdash;ye're maybe no sae decent a man, young Greig.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was impossible for me to conceal even from this tipsy rogue my
astonishment and alarm at this. It seemed to me the devil himself must be
leagued against me in the cause of justice. A cold sweat came on my face
and the palms of my hands. I opened my mouth and meant to give him the lie
but I found I dare not do so in the presence of what seemed a miracle of
heaven.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you ken my name's Greig?&rdquo; I asked at the last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fine that,&rdquo; he made answer, with a grin; &ldquo;and there's mony an odd thing
else I ken.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it's no matter,&rdquo; said I, preparing to quit him, but in great fear
of what the upshot might be; &ldquo;I'm for off, anyway.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
By this time it was obvious that he was not so drunk as I thought him at
first, and that in temper and tact he was my match even with the glass in
him. &ldquo;Do ye ken what I would be doing if I was you?&rdquo; said he seemingly
determined not to let me depart like that, for he took a step or two after
me.
</p>
<p>
I made no reply, but quickened my pace and after me he came, lurching and
catching at my arm; and I mind to this day the roll of him gave me the
impression of a crab.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If it's money ye want-&rdquo; I said at the end of my patience.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Curse your money!&rdquo; he cried, pretending to spit the insult from his
mouth. &ldquo;Curse your money; but if I was you, and a weel-kent skipper like
Dan Risk&mdash;like Dan Risk of the <i>Seven Sisters</i>&mdash;made up to
me out of a redeeculous good nature and nothing else, I would gladly go
and splice the rope with him in the nearest ken.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go and drink with yourself, man,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;there's the money for a
chappin of ate, and I'll forego my share of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I could have done nothing better calculated to infuriate him. As I held
out the coin on the palm of my hand he struck it up with an oath and it
rolled into the syver. His face flamed till the neck of him seemed a round
of seasoned beef.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the Rock o' Bass!&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;I would clap ye in jyle for less than
your lousy groat.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Ah, then, it was in vain I had put the breadth of Scotland between me and
that corpse among the rushes: my heart struggled a moment, and sank as if
it had been drowned in bilge. I turned on the man what must have been a
gallows face, and he laughed, and, gaining his drunken good nature again
he hooked me by the arm, and before my senses were my own again he was
leading me down the street and to the harbour. I had never a word to say.
</p>
<p>
The port, as I tell, was swathed in the haar of the east, out of which
tall masts rose dim like phantom spears; the clumsy tarred bulwarks loomed
like walls along the quay, and the neighbourhood was noisy with voices
that seemed unnatural coming out of the haze. Mariners were hanging about
the sheds, and a low tavern belched others out to keep them company. Risk
made for the tavern, and at that I baulked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, come on!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If I'm no' mistaken Dan Risk's the very man ye're
in the need of. You're wanting out of Scotland, are ye no'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;More than that; I'm wanting out of myself,&rdquo; said I, but that seemed
beyond him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in anyway, and we'll talk it over.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
That he might help me out of the country seemed possible if he was not, as
I feared at first, some agent of the law and merely playing with me, so I
entered the tavern with him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Two gills to the coffin-room, Mrs. Clerihew,&rdquo; he cried to the woman in
the kitchen. &ldquo;And slippy aboot it, if ye please, for my mate here's been
drinking buttermilk all his life, and ye can tell't in his face.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would rather have some meat,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; quo' he, looking at my breeches. &ldquo;A lang ride!&rdquo; He ordered the
food at my mentioning, and made no fuss about drinking my share of the
spirits as well as his own, while I ate with a hunger that was soon
appeased, for my eye, as the saying goes, was iller to satisfy than my
appetite.
</p>
<p>
He sat on the other side of the table in the little room that doubtless
fairly deserved the name it got of coffin, for many a man, I'm thinking,
was buried there in his evil habits; and I wondered what was to be next.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To come to the bit,&rdquo; said the at last, looking hard into the bottom of
his tankard in a way that was a plain invitation to buy more for him. &ldquo;To
come to the bit, you're wanting out of the country?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's true,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but how do you know? And how do you know my name,
for I never saw you to my knowledge in all my life before?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So much the worse for you; I'm rale weel liked by them that kens me. What
would ye give for a passage to Nova Scotia?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a long way,&rdquo; said I, beginning to see a little clearer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I've seen a gey lang rope too, and a man danglin' at
the end of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Again my face betrayed me. I made no answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ken all aboot it,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Your name's Greig; ye're from a place
called the Hazel Den at the other side o' the country; ye've been sailing
wi' a stiff breeze on the quarter all night, and the clime o' auld
Scotland's one that doesna suit your health, eh? What's the amount?&rdquo; said
he, and he looked towards my pocket &ldquo;Could we no' mak' it halfers?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Five pounds,&rdquo; said I, and at that he looked strangely dashed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Five pounds,&rdquo; he repeated incredulously. &ldquo;It seems to have been hardly
worth the while.&rdquo; And then his face changed, as if a new thought had
struck him. He leaned over the table and whispered with the infernal tone
of a confederate, &ldquo;Doused his glim, eh?&rdquo; winking with his hale eye, so
that I could not but shiver at him, as at the touch of slime.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do ye no'?&rdquo; said he, with a sneer; &ldquo;for a Greig ye're mighty slow in the
uptak'. The plain English o' that, then, is that ye've killed a man. A
trifle like that ance happened to a Greig afore.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's your name?&rdquo; I demanded.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I no tellin' ye?&rdquo; said he shortly. &ldquo;It's just Daniel Risk; and where
could you get a better? Perhaps ye were thinkin' aboot swappin' names wi'
me; and by the Bass, it's Dan's family name would suit very weel your
present position,&rdquo; and the scoundrel laughed at his own humour.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I asked because I was frightened it might be Mahoun,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It seems
gey hard to have ridden through mire for a night and a day, and land where
ye started from at the beginning. And how do ye ken all that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;kennin's my trade, if ye want to know. And whatever way I
ken, ye needna think I'm the fellow to make much of a sang aboot it. Still
and on, the thing's frowned doon on in this country, though in places I've
been it would be coonted to your credit. I'll take anither gill; and if ye
ask me, I would drench the butter-milk wi' something o' the same, for the
look o' ye sittin' there's enough to gie me the waterbrash. Mrs. Clerihew&mdash;here!&rdquo;
 He rapped loudly on the table, and the drink coming in I was compelled
again to see him soak himself at my expense. He reverted to my passage
from the country, and &ldquo;Five pounds is little enough for it,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but
ye might be eking it oot by partly working your passage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn't say I was going either to Nova Scotia or with you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
I think I could make a better bargain elsewhere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So could I, maybe,&rdquo; said he, fuming of spirits till I felt sick. &ldquo;And
it's time I was doin' something for the good of my country.&rdquo; With that he
rose to his feet with a look of great moral resolution, and made as if for
the door, but by this time I understood him better.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sit down, ye muckle hash!&rdquo; said I, and I stood over him with a most
threatening aspect.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the Lord!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that's a Greig anyway!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;ye seem to ken the breed. Can I get another vessel abroad
besides yours?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye can not,&rdquo; said he, with a promptness I expected, &ldquo;unless ye wait on
the <i>Sea Pyat</i>. She leaves for Jamaica next Thursday; and there's no'
a spark of the Christian in the skipper o' her, one Macallum from
Greenock.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
For the space of ten minutes I pondered over the situation. Undoubtedly I
was in a hole. This brute had me in his power so long as my feet were on
Scottish land, and he knew it. At sea he might have me in his power too,
but against that there was one precaution I could take, and I made up my
mind.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll give you four pounds&mdash;half at leaving the quay and the other
half when ye land me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My conscience wadna' aloo me,&rdquo; protested the rogue; but the greed was in
his face, and at last he struck my thumb on the bargain, and when he did
that I think I felt as much remorse at the transaction as at the crime
from whose punishment I fled.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;tell me how you knew me and heard about&mdash;about&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; said he, with an affected surprise. &ldquo;Let me tell ye this,
Mr. Greig, or whatever your name may be, that Dan Risk is too much of the
gentleman to have any recollection of any unpleasantness ye may mention,
now that he has made the bargain wi' ye. I ken naethin' aboot ye, if ye
please: whether your name's Greig or Mackay or Habbie Henderson, it's new
to me, only ye're a likely lad for a purser's berth in the <i>Seven
Sisters.</i>&rdquo; And refusing to say another word on the topic that so
interested me, he took me down to the ship's side, where I found the <i>Seven
Sisters</i> was a brigantine out of Hull, sadly in the want of tar upon
her timbers and her mainmast so decayed and worm-eaten that it sounded
boss when I struck it with my knuckles in the by-going.
</p>
<p>
Risk saw me doing it. He gave an ugly smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do ye think o' her? said he, showing me down the companion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mighty little,&rdquo; I told him straight. &ldquo;I'm from the moors,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but
I've had my feet on a sloop of Ayr before now; and by the look of this
craft I would say she has been beeking in the sun idle till she rotted
down to the garboard strake.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He gave his gleed eye a turn and vented some appalling oaths, and wound up
with the insult I might expect&mdash;namely, that drowning was not my
portion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There was some brag a little ago of your being a gentleman,&rdquo; said I,
convinced that this blackguard was to be treated to his own fare if he was
to be got on with at all. &ldquo;There's not much of a gentleman in the like of
that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At this he was taken aback. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don't you cross my temper;
if my temper's crossed it's gey hard to keep up gentility. The ship's
sound enough, or she wouldn't be half a dizen times round the Horn and as
weel kent in Halifax as one o' their ain dories. She's guid enough for
your&mdash;for our business, if ye please, Mr. Greig; and here's my mate
Murchison.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Another tarry-breeks of no more attractive aspect came down the companion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's a new hand for ye,&rdquo; said the skipper humorously.
</p>
<p>
The mate looked me up and down with some contempt from his own height of
little more than five feet four, and peeled an oilskin coat off him. I was
clad myself in a good green coat and breeches with fine wool rig-and-fur
hose, and the buckled red shoon and the cock of my hat I daresay gave me
the look of some importance in tarry-breeks' eyes. At any rate, he did not
take Risk's word for my identity, but at last touched his hat with awkward
fingers after relinquishing his look of contempt.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Jamieson?&rdquo; said he questioningly, and the skipper by this time was
searching in a locker for a bottle of rum he said he had there for the
signing of agreements. &ldquo;Mr. Jamieson,&rdquo; said the mate, &ldquo;I'm glad to see ye.
The money's no; enough for the job, and that's letting ye know. It's all
right for Dan here wi' neither wife nor family, but&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's that, ye idiot?&rdquo; cried Risk turning about in alarm. &ldquo;Do ye tak'
this callan for the owner? I tell't ye he was a new hand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A hand!&rdquo; repeated Murchison, aback and dubious.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jist that; he's the purser.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Murchison laughed. &ldquo;That's a new ornament on the auld randy; he'll be to
keep his keekers on the manifest, like?&rdquo; said he as one who cracks a good
joke. But still and on he scanned me with a suspicious eye, and it was not
till Risk had taken him aside later in the day and seemingly explained,
that he was ready to meet me with equanimity. By that time I had paid the
skipper his two guineas, for the last of his crew was on board, every man
Jack of them as full as the Baltic, and staggering at the coamings of the
hatches not yet down, until I thought half of them would finally land in
the hold.

CHAPTER IX
</h2>
<h3>
WHEREIN THE &ldquo;SEVEN SISTERS&rdquo; ACTS STRANGELY, AND I SIT WAITING FOR THE
MANACLES
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>n air of westerly wind had risen after meridian and the haar was gone, so
that when I stood at the break of the poop as the brigantine crept into
the channel and flung out billows of canvas while her drunken seamen
quarrelled and bawled high on the spars, I saw, as I imagined, the last of
Scotland in a pleasant evening glow. My heart sank. It was not a departure
like this I had many a time anticipated when I listened to Uncle Andys
tales; here was I with blood on my hands and a guinea to start my life in
a foreign country; that was not the worst of it either, for far more
distress was in my mind at the reflection that I travelled with a man who
was in my secret. At first I was afraid to go near him once our ropes were
off the pawls, and I, as it were, was altogether his, but to my surprise
there could be no pleasanter man than Risk when he had the wash of water
under his rotten barque. He was not only a better-mannered man to myself,
but he became, in half an hour of the Firth breeze, as sober as a judge.
But for the roving gleed eye, and what I had seen of him on shore, Captain
Dan Risk might have passed for a model of all the virtues. He called me
Mr. Greig and once or twice (but I stopped that) Young Hazel Den, with no
irony in the appellation, and he was at pains to make his mate see that I
was one to be treated with some respect, proffering me at our first meal
together (for I was to eat in the cuddy,) the first of everything on the
table, and even making some excuses for the roughness of the viands. And I
could see that whatever his qualities of heart might be, he was a good
seaman, a thing to be told in ten minutes by a skipper's step on a deck
and his grip of the rail, and his word of command. Those drunken barnacles
of his seemed to be men with the stuff of manly deeds in them, when at his
word they dashed aloft among the canvas canopy to fist the bulging sail
and haul on clew or gasket, or when they clung on greasy ropes and at a
gesture of his hand heaved cheerily with that &ldquo;yo-ho&rdquo; that is the chant of
all the oceans where keels run.
</p>
<p>
Murchison was a saturnine, silent man, from whom little was to be got of
edification. The crew numbered eight men, one of them a black deaf mute,
with the name of Antonio Ferdinando, who cooked in a galley little larger
than the Hazel Den kennel. It was apparent that no two of them had ever
met before, such a career of flux and change is the seaman's, and except
one of them, a fellow Horn, who was foremast man, a more villainous gang I
never set eyes on before or since. If Risk had raked the ports of Scotland
with a fine bone comb for vermin, he could not have brought together a
more unpleasant-looking crew. No more than two of them brought a bag on
board, and so ragged was their appearance that I felt ashamed to air my
own good clothes on the same deck with them.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately it seemed I had nothing to do with them nor they with me; all
that was ordered for the eking out of my passage, as Risk had said, was to
copy the manifest, and I had no sooner set to that than I discerned it was
a gowk's job just given me to keep me in employ in the cabin. Whatever his
reason, the man did not want me about his deck. I saw that in an interlude
in my writing, when I came up from his airless den to learn what progress
old rotten-beams made under all her canvas.
</p>
<p>
It had declined to a mere handful of wind, and the vessel scarcely moved,
seemed indeed steadfast among the sea-birds that swooped and wheeled and
cried around her. I saw the sun just drop among blood-red clouds over
Stirling, and on the shore of Fife its pleasant glow. The sea swung flat
and oily, running to its ebb, and lapping discernibly upon a recluse
promontory of land with a stronghold on it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you call yon, Horn?&rdquo; I said to the seaman I have before
mentioned, who leaned upon the taffrail and watched the vessel's greasy
wake, and I pointed to the gloomy buildings on the shore.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blackness Castle,&rdquo; said he, and he had time to tell no more, for the
skipper bawled upon him for a shirking dog, and ordered the flemishing of
some ropes loose upon the forward deck. Nor was I exempt from his zeal for
the industry of other folks for he came up to me with a suspicious look,
as if he feared I had been hearing news from his foremast man, and &ldquo;How
goes the manifest, Mr. Greig?&rdquo; says he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, brawly, brawly!&rdquo; said I, determined to begin with Captain Daniel Risk
as I meant to end.
</p>
<p>
He grew purple, but restrained himself with an effort. &ldquo;This is not an Ayr
sloop, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and when orders go on the <i>Seven Sisters</i>
I like to see them implemented. You must understand that there's a
pressing need for your clerking, or I would not be so soon putting you at
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;At this rate of sailing,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I'll have time to copy some hundred
manifests between here and Nova Scotia.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you'll permit me to be the best judge of that,&rdquo; he replied in the
English he ever assumed with his dignity, and seeing there was no more for
it, I went back to my quill.
</p>
<p>
It was little wonder, in all the circumstances, that I fell asleep over my
task with my head upon the cabin table whereon I wrote, and it was still
early in the night when I crawled into the narrow bunk that the skipper
had earlier indicated as mine.
</p>
<p>
Weariness mastered my body, but my mind still roamed; the bunk became a
coffin quicklimed, and the murderer of David Borland lying in it; the
laverock cried across Earn Water and the moors of Renfrew with the voice
of Daniel Risk. And yet the strange thing was that I knew I slept and
dreamed, and more than once I made effort, and dragged myself into
wakefulness from the horrors of my nightmare. At these times there was
nothing to hear but the plop of little waves against the side of the ship,
a tread on deck, and the call of the watch.
</p>
<p>
I had fallen into a sleep more profound than any that had yet blessed my
hard couch, when I was suddenly wakened by a busy clatter on the deck, the
shriek of ill-greased davits, the squeak of blocks, and the fall of a
small-boat into the water. Another odd sound puzzled me: but for the
probability that we were out over Bass I could have sworn it was the
murmur of a stream running upon a gravelled shore. A stream&mdash;heavens!
There could be no doubt about it now; we were somewhere close in shore,
and the <i>Seven Sisters</i> was lying to. The brigantine stopped in her
voyage where no stoppage should be; a small boat plying to land in the
middle of the night; come! here was something out of the ordinary, surely,
on a vessel seaward bound. I had dreamt of the gallows and of Dan Risk as
an informer. Was it a wonder that there should flash into my mind the
conviction of my betrayal? What was more likely than that the skipper,
secure of my brace of guineas, was selling me to the garrison of
Blackness?
</p>
<p>
I clad myself hurriedly and crept cautiously up the companion ladder, and
found myself in overwhelming darkness, only made the more appalling and
strange because the vessel's lights were all extinguished. Silence large
and brooding lay upon the <i>Seven Sisters</i> as she lay in that
obscuring haar that had fallen again; she might be Charon's craft pausing
mid-way on the cursed stream, and waiting for the ferry cry upon the shore
of Time. We were still in the estuary or firth, to judge by the bickering
burn and the odors off-shore, above all the odour of rotting brake; and we
rode at anchor, for her bows were up-water to the wind and tide, and above
me, in the darkness, I could hear the idle sails faintly flapping in the
breeze and the reef-points all tap-tapping. I seemed to have the deck
alone, but for one figure at the stern; I went back, and found that it was
Horn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; I asked, relieved to find there the only man I could trust
on board the ship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A little below Blackness,&rdquo; said he shortly with a dissatisfied tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did not know we were to stop here,&rdquo; said I, wondering if he knew that I
was doomed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; said he, peering into the void of night. &ldquo;And whit's
mair, I wish I could guess the reason o' oor stopping. The skipper's been
ashore mair nor ance wi' the lang-boat forward there, and I'm sent back
here to keep an e'e on lord kens what except it be yersel'.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are ye indeed?&rdquo; said I, exceedingly vexed. &ldquo;Then I ken too well, Horn,
the reason for the stoppage. You are to keep your eye on a man who's being
bargained for with the hangman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would rather ken naithin' about that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and onyway I think
ye're mistaken. Here they're comin' back again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Two or three small boats were coming down on us out of the darkness; not
that I could see them, but that I heard their oars in muffled rowlocks.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If they want me,&rdquo; said I sorrowfully, &ldquo;they can find me down below,&rdquo; and
back I went and sat me in the cabin, prepared for the manacles.

CHAPTER X
</h2>
<h3>
THE STRUGGLE IN THE CABIN, AND AN EERIE SOUND OF RUNNING WATER
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he place stank with bilge and the odour of an ill-trimmed lamp smoking
from a beam; the fragments of the skipper's supper were on the table, with
a broken quadrant; rats scurried and squealed in the bulkheads, and one
stared at me from an open locker, where lay a rum-bottle, while beetles
and slaters travelled along the timbers. But these things compelled my
attention less than the skylights that were masked internally by pieces of
canvas nailed roughly on them. They were not so earlier in the evening; it
must have been done after I had gone to sleep, and what could be the
object? That puzzled me extremely, for it must have been the same hand
that had extinguished all the deck and mast lights, and though black was
my crime darkness was unnecessary to my betrayal.
</p>
<p>
I waited with a heart like lead.
</p>
<p>
I heard the boats swung up on the davits, the squeak of the falls, the
tread of the seamen, the voice of Risk in an unusually low tone. In the
bows in a little I heard the windlass click and the chains rasp in the
hawse-holes; we were lifting the anchor.
</p>
<p>
For a moment hope possessed me. If we were weighing anchor then my arrest
was not imminent at least; but that consolation lasted briefly when I
thought of the numerous alternatives to imprisonment in Blackness.
</p>
<p>
We were under weigh again; there was a heel to port, and a more rapid plop
of the waters along the carvel planks. And then Risk and his mate came
down.
</p>
<p>
I have seldom seen a man more dashed than the skipper when he saw me
sitting waiting on him, clothed and silent. His face grew livid; round he
turned to Murchison and hurried him with oaths to come and clap eyes on
this sea-clerk. I looked for the officer behind them, but they were alone,
and at that I thought more cheerfully I might have been mistaken about the
night's curious proceedings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anything wrang?&rdquo; said Risk, affecting nonchalance now that his spate of
oaths was by, and he pulled the rum out of the locker and helped himself
and his mate to a swingeing caulker.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nothing at all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;at least nothing that I know of, Captain
Risk. And are we&mdash;are we&mdash;at Halifax already?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said he. And then he looked at me closely, put out the
hand unoccupied by his glass and ran an insolent dirty finger over my
new-clipped mole. &ldquo;Greig, Greig,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Greig to a hair! I would have
the wee shears to that again, for its growin'.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're a very noticing man,&rdquo; said I, striking down his hand no way
gently, and remembering that he had seen my scissors when I emerged from
the Borrowstouness close after my own barbering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm all that,&rdquo; he replied, with a laugh, and all the time Murchison, the
mate, sat mopping his greasy face with a rag, as one after hard work, and
looked on us with wonder at what we meant. &ldquo;I'm all that,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;the hair aff the mole and the horse-hair on your creased breeches wad hae
tauld ony ane that ye had ridden in a hurry and clipped in a fricht o'
discovery.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and that's what goes to the makin' o' a Mahoun!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jist that,&rdquo; said he, throwing himself on a seat with an easy indifference
meant to conceal his vanity. &ldquo;Jist observation and a knack o' puttin' twa
and twa thegether. Did ye think the skipper o' the <i>Seven Sisters</i>
was fleein' over Scotland at the tail o' your horse?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Greig mole's weel kent, surely,&rdquo; said I, astonished and chagrined. &ldquo;I
jalouse it's notorious through my Uncle Andy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Risk laughed at that. &ldquo;Oh, ay!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when Andy Greig girned at ye it
was ill to miss seein' his mole. Man, ye might as well wear your name on
the front o' your hat as gae aboot wi' a mole like that&mdash;and&mdash;and
that pair o' shoes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The blood ran to my face at this further revelation of his astuteness. It
seemed, then, I carried my identity head and foot, and it was no wonder a
halfeyed man like Risk should so easily discover me. I looked down at my
feet, and sure enough, when I thought of it now, it would have been a
stupid man who, having seen these kenspeckle shoes once, would ever forget
them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My uncle seems to have given me good introductions,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;They struck
mysel' as rather dandy for a ship,&rdquo; broke in the mate, at last coming on
something he could understand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And did <i>you</i> know Andy Greig, too?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Andy Greig,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;Not me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then, by God, ye hinna sailed muckle aboot the warld!&rdquo; said the skipper.
&ldquo;I hae seen thae shoes in the four quarters and aye in a good
companionship.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They appear yet to retain that virtue,&rdquo; said I, unable to resist the
irony. &ldquo;And, by the way, Captain Risk, now that we have discussed the
shoes and my mole, what have we been waiting for at Blackness?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His face grew black with annoyance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's that to you?&rdquo; he cried.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; I answered indifferently. &ldquo;I thought that now ye had
got the best part o' your passage money ye might hae been thinking to do
something for your country again. They tell me it's a jail in there, and
it might suggest itself to you as providing a good opportunity for getting
rid of a very indifferent purser.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It is one thing I can remember to the man's credit that this innuendo of
treachery seemed to make him frantic. He dashed the rum-glass at his feet
and struck at me with a fist like a jigot of mutton, and I had barely time
to step back and counter. He threw himself at me as he had been a cat; I
closed and flung my arms about him with a wrestler's grip, and bent him
back upon the table edge, where I might have broken his spine but for
Murchison's interference. The mate called loudly for assistance; footsteps
pounded on the cuddy-stair, and down came Horn. Between them they drew us
apart, and while Murchison clung to his captain, and plied him into
quietness with a fresh glass of grog, Horn thrust me not unkindly out into
the night, and with no unwillingness on my part.
</p>
<p>

<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/091.jpg" alt="091" width="100%" /><br />
</div>
<p>
It was the hour of dawn, and the haar was gone.
</p>
<p>
There was something in that chill grey monotone of sky and sea that filled
me with a very passion of melancholy. The wind had risen, and the billows
ran frothing from the east; enormous clouds hung over the land behind us,
so that it seemed to roll with smoke from the eternal fires. Out from that
reeking pit of my remorse&mdash;that lost Scotland where now perhaps there
still lay lying among the rushes, with the pees-weep's cry above it, the
thing from which I flew, our ship went fast, blown upon the frothy
billows, like a ponderous bird, leaving a wake of hissing bubbling brine,
flying, as it seemed, to a world of less imminent danger, yet unalluring
still.
</p>
<p>
I looked aloft at the straining spars; they seemed to prick the clouds
between the swelling sails; the ropes and shrouds stretched infinitely
into a region very grey and chill. Oh, the pallor! oh, the cold and
heartless spirit of the sea in that first dawning morn!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's like to be a good day,&rdquo; said Horn, breaking in upon my silence, and
turning to him I saw his face exceeding hollow and wan. The watch lay
forward, all but a lad who seemed half-dozing at the helm; Risk and his
mate had lapsed to silence in the cuddy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're no frien', seemingly, o' the pair below!&rdquo; said Horn again,
whispering, and with a glance across his shoulder at the helm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It did not look as if I were, a minute or two ago,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Yon's a
scoundrel, and yet I did him an injustice when I thought he meant to sell
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never sailed with a more cheat-the-widdy crew since I followed the
sea,&rdquo; said Horn, &ldquo;and whether it's the one way or the other, sold ye are.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said I, uncomprehending.
</p>
<p>
He looked again at the helm, and moved over to a water-breaker further
forward, obviously meaning that I should follow. He drew a drink of water
for himself, drank slowly, but seemed not to be much in the need for it
from the little he took, but he had got out of ear-shot of the man
steering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You and me's the gulls this time, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; said he, whispering. &ldquo;This
is a doomed ship.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought as much from her rotten spars,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;So long as she
takes me to Nova Scotia I care little what happens to her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a long way to Halifax,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I wish I could be sure we were
likely even to have Land's End on our starboard before waur happens. Will
ye step this way, Mr. Greig?&rdquo; and he cautiously led the way forward. There
was a look-out humming a stave of song somewhere in the bows, and two men
stretched among the chains, otherwise that part of the ship was all our
own. We went down the fo'c'sle scuttle quietly, and I found myself among
the carpenter's stores, in darkness, divided by a bulkhead door from the
quarters of the sleeping men. Rats were scurrying among the timbers and
squealing till Horn stamped lightly with his feet and secured stillness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
I could hear nothing but the heavy breathing of a seaman within, and the
wash of water against the ship's sides.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I queried, wondering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Put your lug here,&rdquo; said he, indicating a beam that was dimly revealed by
the light from the lamp swinging in the fo'c'sle. I did so, and heard
water running as from a pipe somewhere in the bowels of the vessel.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's all,&rdquo; said he and led me aft again.
</p>
<p>
The dawn by now had spread over half the heavens; behind us the mouth of
the Firth gulped enormous clouds, and the fringe of Fife was as flat as a
bannock; before us the sea spread chill, leaden, all unlovely. &ldquo;My
sorrow!&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if this is travelling, give me the high-roads and the
hot noon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Horn's face seemed more hollow and dark than ever in the wan morning. I
waited his explanation. &ldquo;I think ye said Halifax, Mr. Greig?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
signed on, mysel', for the same port, but you and me's perhaps the only
ones on this ship that ever hoped to get there. God give me grace to get
foot on shore and Dan Risk will swing for this!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Somebody sneezed behind us as Horn thus rashly expressed himself; we both
turned suddenly on the rail we had been leaning against, expecting that
this was the skipper, and though it was not Risk, it was one whose black
visage and gleaming teeth and rolling eyes gave me momentarily something
of a turn.
</p>
<p>
It was the cook Ferdinando. He had come up behind on his bare feet, and
out upon the sea he gazed with that odd eerie look of the deaf and dumb,
heedless of us, it seemed, as we had been dead portions of the ship's
fabric, seeing but the salt wave, the rim of rising sun, blood-red upon
the horizon, communing with an old familiar.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A cauld momin', cook,&rdquo; said Horn, like one who tests a humbug pretending
to be dumb, but Ferdinando heard him not.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It might have been a man wi' all his faculties,&rdquo; said the seaman
whispering, &ldquo;and it's time we werena seen thegether. I'll tell ye later
on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With that we separated, he to some trivial duty of his office, I, with a
mind all disturbed, back to my berth to lie awake, tossing and speculating
on the meaning of Horn's mystery.

CHAPTER XI
</h2>
<h3>
THE SCUTTLED SHIP
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen I went on deck next morning there was something great ado. We were
out of sight of land, sailing large, as the old phrase went, on a brisk
quarter breeze with top-sails atrip, and the sky a vast fine open blue.
The crew were gathered at the poop, the pump was clanking in the midst of
them, and I saw they were taking spells at the cruellest labour a seaman
knows.
</p>
<p>
At first I was noway troubled at the spectacle; a leak was to be expected
in old rotten-beams, and I went forward with the heart of me not a pulse
the faster.
</p>
<p>
Risk was leaning over the poop-rail, humped up and his beard on his hands;
Murchison, a little apart, swept the horizon with a prospect-glass, and
the pump sent a great spate of bilge-water upon the deck. But for a man at
the tiller who kept the ship from yawing in the swell that swung below her
counter the <i>Seven Sisters</i> sailed at her sweet will; all the
interest of her company was in this stream of stinking water that she
retched into the scuppers. And yet I could not but be struck by the
half-hearted manner in which the seamen wrought; they were visibly
shirking; I saw it in the slack muscles, in the heedless eyes.
</p>
<p>
Risk rose and looked sourly at me as I went up. &ldquo;Are ye for a job?&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;It's more in your line perhaps than clerkin'.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, at the pumps? Is the old randy geyzing already?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Like a washing-boyne,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Bear a hand like a good lad! we maun
keep her afloat at least till some other vessel heaves in sight.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In the tone and look of the man there was something extraordinary. His
words were meant to suggest imminent peril, and yet his voice was shallow
as that of a burgh bellman crying an auction sale, and his eyes had more
interest in the horizon that his mate still searched with the
prospect-glass than in the spate of bilge that gulped upon the deck.
</p>
<p>
Bilge did I say? Heavens! it was bilge no more, but the pure sea-green
that answered to the clanking pump. It was no time for idle wonder at the
complacence of the skipper; I flew to the break and threw my strength into
the seaman's task. &ldquo;Clank-click, clank-click&rdquo;&mdash;the instrument worked
reluctantly as if the sucker moved in slime, and in a little the sweat
poured from me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How is she now, Campbell?&rdquo; asked Risk, as the carpenter came on deck.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Three feet in the hold,&rdquo; said Campbell airily, like one that had an easy
conscience.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good lord, a foot already!&rdquo; cried Risk, and then in a tone of sarcasm,
&ldquo;Hearty, lads, hearty there! A little more Renfrewshire beef into it, Mr.
Greig, if you please.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At that I ceased my exertion, stood back straight and looked at the faces
about me. There was only one man in the company who did not seem to be
amused at me, and that was Horn, who stood with folded arms, moodily eying
the open sea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You seem mighty joco about it,&rdquo; I said to Risk, and I wonder to this day
at my blindness that never read the whole tale in these hurried events.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can afford to be,&rdquo; he said quickly; &ldquo;if I gang I gang wi' clean hands,&rdquo;
 and he spat into the seawater streaming from the pump where the port-watch
now were working with as much listlessness as the men they superseded.
</p>
<p>
To the taunt I made no reply, but moved after Horn who had gone forward
with his hands in his pockets.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What does this mean, Horn?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;Is the vessel in great danger?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose she is,&rdquo; said he bitterly, &ldquo;but I have had nae experience o'
scuttled ships afore.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Scuttled!&rdquo; cried I, astounded, only half grasping his meaning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jist that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The job's begun. It began last night in the run of
the vessel as I showed ye when ye put your ear to the beam. After I left
ye, I foun' half a dizen cords fastened to the pump stanchels; ane of them
I pulled and got a plug at the end of it; the ithers hae been comin' oot
since as it suited Dan Risk best, and the <i>Seven Ststers</i> is doomed
to die o' a dropsy this very day. Wasn't I the cursed idiot that ever
lipped drink in Clerihew's coffin-room!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If it was that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why did you not cut the cords and spoil the
plot?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cut the cords! Ye mean cut my ain throat; that's what wad happen if the
skipper guessed my knowledge o' his deevilry. And dae ye think a gallows
job o' this kind depends a'thegither on twa or three bits o' twine? Na,
na, this is a very business-like transaction, Mr. Greig, and I'll warrant
there has been naethin' left to chance. I wondered at them bein' sae
pernicketty about the sma' boats afore we sailed when the timbers o' the
ship hersel' were fair ganting. That big new boat and sails frae Kirkcaldy
was a gey odd thing in itsel' if I had been sober enough to think o't. I
suppose ye paid your passage, Mr. Greig? I can fancy a purser on the <i>Seven
Sisters</i> upon nae ither footin' and that made me dubious o' ye when I
first learned o' this hell's caper for Jamieson o' the Grange. If ye hadna
fought wi' the skipper I would hae coonted ye in wi' the rest.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has two pounds of my money,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;at least I've saved the
other two if we fail to reach Halifax.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At that he laughed softly again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It might be as well wi' Risk as wi' the conger,&rdquo; said he, meaningly. &ldquo;I'm
no' sae sure that you and me's meant to come oot o' this; that's what I
might tak' frae their leaving only the twa o' us aft when they were
puttin' the cargo aff there back at Blackness.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The cargo!&rdquo; I repeated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Horn. &ldquo;Ye fancied they were goin' to get rid o' ye
there, did ye? I'll alloo I thought that but a pretence on your pairt, and
no' very neatly done at that. Well, the smallest pairt but the maist
valuable o' the cargo shipped at Borrowstouness is still in Scotland; and
the underwriters 'll be to pay through the nose for what has never run sea
risks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At that a great light came to me. This was the reason for the masked cuddy
skylights, the utter darkness of the <i>Seven Sisters</i> while her boats
were plying to the shore; for this was I so closely kept at her ridiculous
manifest; the lists of lace and plate I had been fatuously copying were
lists of stuff no longer on the ship at all, but back in the possession of
the owner of the brigantine.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are an experienced seaman&mdash;?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have had a vessel of my own,&rdquo; broke in Horn, some vanity as well as
shame upon his countenance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, you are the more likely to know the best way out of this trap we
are in,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;For a certain reason I am not at all keen on it to go
back to Scotland, but I would sooner risk that than run in leash with a
scoundrel like this who's sinking his command, not to speak of hazarding
my unworthy life with a villainous gang. Is there any way out of it,
Horn?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The seaman pondered, a dark frown upon his tanned forehead, where the
veins stood out in knots, betraying his perturbation. The wind whistled
faintly in the tops, the <i>Seven Sisters</i> plainly went by the head;
she had a slow response to her helm, and moved sluggishly. Still the pump
was clanking and we could hear the water streaming through the scupper
holes. Risk had joined his mate and was casting anxious eyes over the
waters.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If we play the safty here, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; said Horn, &ldquo;there's a chance o' a
thwart for us when the <i>Seven Ststers</i> comes to her labour. That's
oor only prospect. At least they daurna murder us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what about the crew?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Do you tell me there is not enough
honesty among them all to prevent a blackguardly scheme like this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We're the only twa on this ship this morning wi' oor necks ootside tow,
for they're all men o' the free trade, and broken men at that,&rdquo; said Horn
resolutely, and even in the midst of this looming disaster my private
horror rose within me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, helpless to check the revelation, &ldquo;speak for yourself, Mr.
Horn; it's the hangman I'm here fleeing from.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He looked at me with quite a new countenance, clearly losing relish for
his company.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anything by-ordinar dirty?&rdquo; he asked, and in my humility I did not have
the spirit to resent what that tone and query implied.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dirty enough,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the man's dead,&rdquo; and Horn's face cleared.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, faith! is that all?&rdquo; quo' he, &ldquo;I was thinkin' it might be coinin'&mdash;beggin'
your pardon, Mr. Greig, or somethin' in the fancy way. But a gentleman's
quarrel ower the cartes or a wench&mdash;that's a different tale. I hate
homicide mysel' to tell the truth, but whiles I've had it in my heart, and
in a way o' speakin* Dan Risk this meenute has my gully-knife in his
ribs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As he spoke the vessel, mishandled, or a traitor to her helm, now that she
was all awash internally with water, yawed and staggered in the wind. The
sails shivered, the yards swung violently, appalling noises came from the
hold. At once the pumping ceased, and Risk's voice roared in the
confusion, ordering the launch of the Kirkcaldy boat.

CHAPTER XII
</h2>
<h3>
MAKES PLAIN THE DEEPEST VILLAINY OF RISK AND SETS ME ON A FRENCHMAN
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen I come to write these affairs down after the lapse of years, I find
my memory but poorly retains the details of that terrific period between
the cry of Risk and the moment when Horn and I, abandoned on the doomed
vessel, watched the evening fall upon the long Kirkcaldy boat, her mast
stepped, but her sails down, hovering near us for the guarantee of our
eternal silence regarding the crime the men on her were there and then
committing. There is a space&mdash;it must have been brief, but I lived a
lifetime in it&mdash;whose impressions rest with me, blurred, but with the
general hue of agony. I can see the sun again sailing overhead in the
arching sky of blue; the enormous ocean, cruel, cold, spread out to the
line of the horizon; the flapping sails and drumming reef-points, the
streaming halliards and clew-garnets, the spray buffeting upon our hull
and spitting in our faces like an enemy; I hear the tumult of the seamen
hurrying vulgarly to save their wretched lives, the gluck of waters in the
bowels of the ship, the thud of cargo loose and drifting under decks.
</p>
<p>
But I see and hear it all as in a dream or play, and myself someway
standing only a spectator.
</p>
<p>
It seemed that Risk and his men put all their dependence on the long-boat
out of Kirkcaldy. She was partly decked at the bows like a Ballantrae
herring-skiff, beamy and commodious. They clustered round her like ants;
swung her out, and over she went, and the whole hellish plot lay revealed
in the fact that she was all found with equipment and provisions.
</p>
<p>
Horn and I made an effort to assist at her preparation; we were shoved
aside with frantic curses; we were beaten back by her oars when we sought
to enter her, and when she pushed off from the side of the <i>Seven
Sisters</i>, Dan Risk was so much the monster that he could jeer at our
perplexity. He sat at the tiller of her without a hat, his long hair, that
was turning lyart, blown by the wind about his black and mocking eyes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Head her for Halifax, Horn,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and ye'll get there by-and-by.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did I ever do ye any harm, skipper?&rdquo; cried the poor seaman, standing on
the gunwale, hanging to the shrouds, and his aspect hungry for life.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye never got the chance, Port Glesca,&rdquo; cried back Risk, hugging the
tiller of the Kirkcaldy boat under his arm. &ldquo;I'll gie ye a guess&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Come-a-riddle, come-a-riddle, come-a-rote-tote-tote&mdash;
</pre>
<p>
Oh to bleezes! I canna put a rhyme till't, but this is the sense o't&mdash;a
darkie's never deaf and dumb till he's deid. Eh! Antonio, ye rascal!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He looked forward as he spoke and exchanged a villainous laugh with the
cook, his instrument, who had overheard us and betrayed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye would mak' me swing for it, would ye, John Horn, when ye get ashore?
That's what I would expect frae a keelie oot o' Clyde.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It is hard to credit that man could be so vile as this, but of such stuff
was Daniel Risk. He was a fiend in the glory of his revenge upon the
seaman who had threatened him with the gallows; uplifted like a madman's,
his face, that was naturally sallow, burned lamp-red at his high
cheek-bones, his hale eye gloated, his free hand flourished as in an
exultation. His mate sat silent beside him on the stern-thwart, clearing
the sheets: the crew, who had out the sweeps to keep the boat's bows in
the wind, made an effort to laugh at his jocosities, but clearly longed to
be away from this tragedy. And all the time, I think, I stood beside the
weather bulwark, surrendered to the certainty of a speedy death, with the
lines of a ballad coming back again and again to my mind:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
An' he shall lie in fathoms deep,
The star-fish ower his een shall creep.
An' an auld grey wife shall sit an' weep
In the hall o' Monaltrie.
</pre>
<p>
I thrust that ungodly rhyme from me each time that it arose, but in spite
of me at last it kept time to the lap of a wave of encroaching sea that
beat about my feet.
</p>
<p>
My silence&mdash;my seeming indifference&mdash;would seem to have touched
the heart that could not be affected by the entreaties of the seaman Horn.
At least Risk ceased his taunts at last, and cast a more friendly eye on
me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm saying, Greig,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;noo that I think o't, your Uncle Andy was
no bad hand at makin' a story. Ye've an ill tongue, but I'll thole that&mdash;astern,
lads, and tak' the purser aboard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The seamen set the boat about willingly enough, and she crept in to pick
me off the doomed ship.
</p>
<p>
At that my senses cleared like hill-well water. It was for but a second&mdash;praise
God! my instincts joyed in my reprieve; my hand never released the cleat
by which I steadied myself. I looked at Horn still upon the lower shrouds
and saw hope upon his countenance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course this man comes with me, Captain Risk?&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not if he offered a thousand pounds,&rdquo; cried Risk, &ldquo;in ye come!&rdquo; and
Murchison clawed at the shrouds with a boat-hook. Horn made to jump among
them and, with an oath, the mate thrust at him with the hook as with a
spear, striking him under the chin. He fell back upon the deck, bleeding
profusely and half insensible.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are a foul dog!&rdquo; I cried to his assailant. &ldquo;And I'll settle with you
for that!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jump, ye fool, ye, jump!&rdquo; cried Risk impatient.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us look oot for oorselves, that's whit I say,&rdquo; cried Murchison angry
at my threat, and prepared cheerfully to see me perish. &ldquo;What for should
we risk oor necks with either o' them?&rdquo; and he pushed off slightly with
his boat-hook.
</p>
<p>
The skipper turned, struck down the hook, and snarled upon him. &ldquo;Shut up,
Murchison!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I'm still the captain, if ye please, and I ken as
much about the clerk here as will keep his gab shut on any trifle we hae
dune.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I looked upon the clean sea, and then at that huddle of scoundrels in the
Kirkcaldy boat, and then upon the seaman Horn coming back again to the
full consciousness of his impending fate. He gazed upon me with eyes
alarmed and pitiful, and at that I formed my resolution.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I stick by Horn,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;If he gets too, I'll go; if not I'll bide and
be drowned with an honest man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bide and be damned then! Ye've had your chance,&rdquo; shouted Risk, letting
his boat fall off. &ldquo;It's time we werena here.&rdquo; And the halliards of his
main-sail were running in the blocks as soon as he said it. The boat swept
away rapidly, but not before I gave him a final touch of my irony. From my
pocket I took out my purse and threw it upon his lap.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's the ither twa, Risk,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;it's no' like the thing at all to
murder a harmless lad for less than what ye bargained for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He bawled back some reply I could not hear, and I turned about, to see
Horn making for the small boat on the starboard chocks. I followed with a
hope again wakened, only to share his lamentation when he found that two
of her planks had been wantonly sprung from their clinkers, rendering her
utterly useless. The two other boats were in a similar condition; Risk and
his confederates had been determined that no chance should be left of our
escape from the <i>Seven Sisters</i>.
</p>
<p>
It was late in the afternoon. The wind had softened somewhat; in the west
there were rising billowy clouds of silver and red, and half a mile away
the Kirkcaldy boat, impatient doubtless for the end of us, that final
assurance of safety, plied to windward with only her foresail set. We had
gone below in a despairing mind on the chance that the leakage might be
checked, but the holes were under water in the after peak, and in other
parts we could not come near. An inch-and-a-half auger, and a large
bung-borer, a gouge and chisel in the captain's private locker, told us
how the crime had been committed whereof we were the victims.
</p>
<p>
We had come on deck again, the pair of us, without the vaguest notion of
what was next to do, and&mdash;speaking for myself&mdash;convinced that
nothing could avert our hurrying fate. Horn told me later that he proposed
full half a score of plans for at least a prolongation of our time, but
that I paid no heed to them. That may be, for I know the ballad stanza
went in my head like a dirge, as I sat on a hatch with the last few days
of my history rolling out before my eyes. The dusk began to fall like a
veil, the wind declined still further. Horn feverishly hammered and
caulked at the largest of the boats, now and then throwing the tools from
him as in momentary realisations of the hopelessness of his toil that
finally left him in despair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's no use, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; he cried then, &ldquo;they did the job ower weel,&rdquo; and
he shook his fist at the Kirkcaldy boat. He checked the gesture suddenly
and gave an astonished cry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They're gone, Greig,&rdquo; said he, now frantic. &ldquo;They're gone. O God! they're
gone! I was sure they couldna hae the heart to leave us at the last,&rdquo; and
as he spoke I chanced to look astern, and behold! a ship with all her
canvas full was swiftly bearing down the wind upon us. We had been so
intent upon our fate that we had never seen her!
</p>
<p>
I clambered up the shrouds of the main-mast, and cried upon the coming
vessel with some mad notion that she might fancy the <i>Seven Sisters</i>
derelict. But indeed that was not necessary. In a little she went round
into the wind, a long-boat filled with men came towards us, and twenty
minutes later we were on the deck of the <i>Roi Rouge</i>.

CHAPTER XIII
</h2>
<h3>
WHEREIN APPEARS A GENTLEMANLY CORSAIR AND A FRENCH-IRISH LORD
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile it may be that the actual crisis of my manhood came to me on the day
I first put on my Uncle Andrew's shoes, the sense of it was mine only when
I met with Captain Thurot. I had put the past for ever behind me (as I
fancied) when I tore the verses of a moon-struck boy and cast them out
upon the washing-green at Hazel Den, but I was bound to foregather with
men like Thurot and his friends ere the scope and fashion of a man's world
were apparent to me. Whether his influence on my destiny in the long run
was good or bad I would be the last to say; he brought me into danger, but&mdash;in
a manner&mdash;he brought me good, though that perhaps was never in his
mind.
</p>
<p>
You must fancy this Thurot a great tall man, nearly half a foot exceeding
myself in stature, peak-bearded, straight as a lance, with plum-black eyes
and hair, polished in dress and manner to the rarest degree and with a
good humour that never failed. He sat under a swinging lamp in his cabin
when Horn and I were brought before him, and asked my name first in an
accent of English that was if anything somewhat better than my own.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Greig,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;Paul Greig,&rdquo; and he started as if I had pricked him with
a knife.
</p>
<p>
A little table stood between us, on which there lay a book he had been
reading when we were brought below, some hours after the <i>Seven Sisters</i>
had gone down, and the search for the Kirkcaldy boat had been abandoned.
He took the lamp off its hook, came round the table and held the light so
that he could see my face the clearer. At any time his aspect was manly
and pleasant; most of all was it so when he smiled, and I was singularly
encouraged when he smiled at me, with a rapid survey of my person that
included the Hazel Den mole and my Uncle Andrew's shoes.
</p>
<p>
A seaman stood behind us; to him he spoke a message I could not
comprehend, as it was in French, of which I had but little. The seaman
retired; we were offered a seat, and in a minute the seaman came back with
a gentleman&mdash;a landsman by his dress.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon, my lord,&rdquo; said the captain to his visitor, &ldquo;but I thought that
here was a case&mdash;speaking of miracles&mdash;you would be interested
in. Our friends here&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated myself particularly with a
gracious gesture&mdash;&ldquo;are not, as you know, dropped from heaven, but
come from that unfortunate ship we saw go under a while ago. May I ask
your lordship to tell us&mdash;you will see the joke in a moment&mdash;whom
we were talking of at the moment our watch first announced the sight of
that vessel?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His lordship rubbed his chin and smilingly peered at the captain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are the deuce and all, Thurot. What are you in the
mood for now? Why, we talked of Greig&mdash;Andrew Greig, the best player
of <i>passe-passe</i> and the cheerfullest loser that ever cut a pack.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thurot turned to me, triumphant.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how ridiculously small the world is. <i>Ma foi!</i> I
wonder how I manage so well to elude my creditors, even when I sail the
high seas. Lord Clancarty, permit me to have the distinguished honour to
introduce another Greig, who I hope has many more of his charming uncle's
qualities than his handsome eyes and red shoes. I assume it is a nephew,
because poor Monsieur Andrew was not of the marrying kind. Anyhow, 'tis a
Greig of the blood, or Antoine Thurot is a bat! And&mdash;Monsieur Greig,
it is my felicity to bid you know one of your uncle's best friends and
heartiest admirers&mdash;Lord Clancarty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord Clancarty!&rdquo; I cried, incredulous. &ldquo;Why he figured in my uncle's
log-book a dozen years ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A dozen, no less!&rdquo; cried his lordship, with a grimace. &ldquo;We need not be so
particular about the period. I trust he set me down there a decently good
companion; I could hardly hope to figure in a faithful scribe's tablets as
an example otherwise,&rdquo; said his lordship, laughing and taking me cordially
by the hand. &ldquo;Gad! one has but to look at you to see Andrew Greig in every
line. I loved your uncle, lad. He had a rugged, manly nature, and just
sufficient folly, bravado, and sinfulness to keep a poor Irishman in
countenance. Thurot, one must apologise for taking from your very lips the
suggestion I see hesitating there, but sure 'tis an Occasion this; it must
be a bottle&mdash;the best bottle on your adorable but somewhat ill-found
vessel. Why 'tis Andy Greig come young again. Poor Andy! I heard of his
death no later than a month ago, and have ordered a score of masses for
him&mdash;which by the way are still unpaid for to good Father Hamilton. I
could not sleep happily of an evening&mdash;of a forenoon rather&mdash;if
I thought of our Andy suffering aught that a few candles and such-like
could modify.&rdquo; And his lordship with great condescension tapped and passed
me his jewelled box of maccabaw.
</p>
<p>
You can fancy a raw lad, untutored and untravelled, fresh from the
plough-tail, as it were, was vastly tickled at this introduction to the
genteel world. I was no longer the shivering outlaw, the victim of a Risk.
I was honoured more or less for the sake of my uncle (whose esteem in this
quarter my father surely would have been surprised at), and it seemed as
though my new life in a new country were opening better than I had planned
myself. I blessed my shoes&mdash;the Shoes of Sorrow&mdash;and for the
time forgot the tragedy from which I was escaping.
</p>
<p>
They birled the bottle between them, Clancarty and Thurot, myself
virtually avoiding it, but clinking now and then, and laughing with them
at the numerous exploits they recalled of him that was the bond between
us; Horn elsewhere found himself well treated also; and listening to these
two gentlemen of the world, their allusions, off-hand, to the great, their
indications of adventure, travel, intrigue, enterprise, gaiety, I saw my
horizon expand until it was no longer a cabin on the sea I sat in, with
the lamplight swinging over me, but a spacious world of castles, palaces,
forests, streets, churches, casernes, harbours, masquerades, routs,
operas, love, laughter, and song. Perhaps they saw my elation and fully
understood, and smiled within them at my efforts to figure as a little man
of the world too&mdash;as boys will&mdash;but they never showed me other
than the finest sympathy and attention.
</p>
<p>
I found them fascinating at night; I found them much the same at morning,
which is the test of the thing in youth, and straightway made a hero of
the foreigner Thurot. Clancarty was well enough, but without any method in
his life, beyond a principle of keeping his character ever trim and
presentable like his cravat. Thurot carried on his strenuous career as
soldier, sailor, spy, politician, with a plausible enough theory that thus
he got the very juice and pang of life, that at the most, as he would aye
be telling me, was brief to an absurdity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Scots,&rdquo; he would say to me, &ldquo;as a rule, are too phlegmatic&mdash;is
it not, Lord Clancarty?&mdash;but your uncle gave me, on my word, a regard
for your whole nation. He had aplomb&mdash;Monsieur Andrew; he had luck
too, and if he cracked a nut anywhere there was always a good kernel in
it.&rdquo; And the shoes see how I took the allusion to King George, and that
gave me a flood of light upon my new position.
</p>
<p>
I remembered that in my uncle's log-book the greater part of the narrative
of his adventures in France had to do with politics and the intrigues of
the Jacobite party. He was not, himself, apparently, &ldquo;out,&rdquo; as we call it,
in the affair of the 'Forty-five, because he did not believe the occasion
suitable, and thought the Prince precipitous, but before and after that
untoward event for poor Scotland, he had been active with such men as
Clancarty, Lord Clare, the Murrays, the Mareschal, and such-like, which
was not to be wondered at, perhaps, for our family had consistently been
Jacobite, a fact that helped to its latter undoing, though my father as
nominal head of the house had taken no interest in politics; and my own
sympathies had ever been with the Chevalier, whom I as a boy had seen ride
through the city of Glasgow, wishing myself old enough to be his follower
in such a glittering escapade as he was then embarked on.
</p>
<p>
But though I thought all this in a flash as it were, I betrayed nothing to
Captain Thurot, who seemed somewhat dashed at my silence. There must have
been something in my face, however, to show that I fully realised what he
was feeling at, and was not too complacent, for Clancarty laughed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure, 'tis a good boy, Thurot,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and loves his King George
properly, like a true patriot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I won't believe it of a Greig,&rdquo; said Captain Thurot. &ldquo;A pestilent, dull
thing, loyalty in England; the other thing came much more readily, I
remember, to the genius of Andrew Greig. Come! Monsieur Paul, to be quite
frank about it, have you no instincts of friendliness to the exiled house?
M. Tête-de-fer has a great need at this particular moment for English
friends. Once he could count on your uncle to the last ditch; can he count
on the nephew?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;M. Tête-de-fer?&rdquo; I repeated, somewhat bewildered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;M. Tête-de-mouche, rather,&rdquo; cried my lord, testily, and then hurried to
correct himself. &ldquo;He alluded, Monsieur Greig, to Prince Charles Edward. We
are all, I may confess, his Royal Highness's most humble servants; some of
us, however&mdash;as our good friend, Captain Thurot&mdash;more actively
than others. For myself I begin to weary of a cause that has been dormant
for eight years, but no matter; sure one must have a recreation!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I looked at his lordship to see if he was joking. He was the relic of a
handsome man, though still, I daresay, less than fifty years of age, with
a clever face and gentle, just tinged by the tracery of small surface
veins to a redness that accused him of too many late nights; his mouth and
eyes, that at one time must have been fascinating, had the ultimate
irresolution that comes to one who finds no fingerposts at life's
cross-roads and thinks one road just as good's another. He was born at
Atena, near Hamburg (so much I had remembered from my uncle's memoir), but
he was, even in his accent, as Irish as Kerry. Someway I liked and yet
doubted him, in spite of all the praise of him that I had read in a dead
man's diurnal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Fi donc! vous devriez avoir honte, milord</i>,&rdquo; cried Thurot, somewhat
disturbed, I saw, at this reckless levity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ashamed!&rdquo; said his lordship, laughing; &ldquo;why, 'tis for his Royal Highness
who has taken a diligence to the devil, and left us poor dependants to pay
the bill at the inn. But no matter, Master Greig, I'll be cursed if I say
a single word more to spoil a charming picture of royalty under a cloud.&rdquo;
 And so saying he lounged away from us, a strange exquisite for shipboard,
laced up to the nines, as the saying goes, parading the deck as it had
been the Rue St. Honoré, with merry words for every sailorman who tapped a
forehead to him.
</p>
<p>
Captain Thurot looked at him, smiling, and shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Tête-de-mouche!</i> There it is for you, M. Paul&mdash;the head of a
butterfly. Now you&mdash;&rdquo; he commanded my eyes most masterfully&mdash;&ldquo;now
<i>you</i> have a Scotsman's earnestness; I should like to see you on the
right side. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, you owe us your life, no less; 'tis no more
King George's, for one of his subjects has morally sent you to the bottom
of the sea in a scuttled ship. I wish we had laid hands on your Risk and
his augers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But I was learning my world; I was cautious; I said neither yea nor nay.

CHAPTER XIV
</h2>
<h3>
IN DUNKERQUE&mdash;A LADY SPEAKS TO ME IN SCOTS AND A FAT PRIEST SEEMS TO
HAVE SOMETHING ON HIS MIND
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>wo days after, the <i>Roi Rouge</i> came to Dunkerque; Horn the seaman
went home to Scotland in a vessel out of Leith with a letter in his pocket
for my people at Hazel Den, and I did my best for the next fortnight to
forget by day the remorse that was my nightmare. To this Captain Thurot
and Lord Clancarty, without guessing 'twas a homicide they favoured,
zealously helped me.
</p>
<p>
And then Dunkerque at the moment was sparkling with attractions. Something
was in its air to distract every waking hour, the pulse of drums, the
sound of trumpets calling along the shores, troops manoeuvring, elation
apparent in every countenance. I was Thurot's guest in a lodging over a <i>boulangerie</i>
upon the sea front, and at daybreak I would look out from the little
window to see regiments of horse and foot go by on their way to an
enormous camp beside the old fort of Risebank. Later in the morning I
would see the soldiers toiling at the grand sluice for deepening the
harbour or repairing the basin, or on the dunes near Graveline manoeuvring
under the command of the Prince de Soubise and Count St. Germain. All day
the paving thundered with the roll of tumbrels, with the noise of plunging
horse; all night the front of the <i>boulangerie</i> was clamorous with
carriages bearing cannon, timber, fascines, gabions, and other military
stores.
</p>
<p>
Thurot, with his ship in harbour, became a man of the town, with ruffled
neck- and wrist-bands, the most extravagant of waistcoats, hats laced with
point d'Espagne, and up and down Dunkerque he went with a restless foot as
if the conduct of the world depended on him. He sent an old person, a
reduced gentleman, to me to teach me French that I laboured with as if my
life depended on it from a desire to be as soon as possible out of his
reverence, for, to come to the point and be done with it, he was my
benefactor to the depth of my purse.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes Lord Clancarty asked me out to a <i>déjeuner</i>. He moved in a
society where I met many fellow countrymen&mdash;Captain Foley, of Rooth's
regiment; Lord Roscommon and his brother young Dillon; Lochgarry,
Lieutenant-Colonel of Ogilvie's Corps, among others, and by-and-by I
became known favourably in what, if it was not actually the select society
of Dunkerque, was so at least in the eyes of a very ignorant young
gentleman from the moors of Mearns.
</p>
<p>
It was so strange a thing as to be almost incredible, but my Uncle Andy's
shoes seemed to have some magic quality that brought them for ever on
tracks they had taken before, and if my cast of countenance did not
proclaim me a Greig wherever I went, the shoes did so. They were a
passport to the favour of folks the most divergent in social state&mdash;to
a poor Swiss who kept the door and attended on the table at Clancarty's
(my uncle, it appeared, had once saved his life), and to Soubise himself,
who counted my uncle the bravest man and the best mimic he had ever met,
and on that consideration alone pledged his influence to find me a post.
</p>
<p>
You may be sure I did not wear such tell-tale shoes too often. I began to
have a freit about them as he had to whom they first belonged, and to
fancy them somehow bound up with my fortune.
</p>
<p>
I put them on only when curiosity prompted me to test what new
acquaintances they might make me, and one day I remember I donned them for
a party of blades at Lord Clancarty's, the very day indeed upon which the
poor Swiss, weeping, told me what he owed to the old rogue with the
scarred brow now lying dead in the divots of home.
</p>
<p>
There was a new addition to the company that afternoon&mdash;a priest who
passed with the name of Father Hamilton, though, as I learned later, he
was formerly Vliegh, a Fleming, born at Ostend, and had been educated
partly at the College Major of Louvain and partly in London. He was or had
been parish priest of Dixmunde near Ostend, and his most decent memory of
my uncle, whom he, too, knew, was a challenge to a drinking-bout in which
the thin man of Meams had been several bottles more thirsty than the fat
priest of Dixmunde.
</p>
<p>
He was corpulent beyond belief, with a dewlap like an ox; great limbs, a
Gargantuan appetite, and a laugh like thunder that at its loudest created
such convulsions of his being as compelled him to unbutton the neck of his
<i>soutane</i>, else he had died of a seizure.
</p>
<p>
His friends at Lord Clancarty's played upon him a little joke wherein I
took an unconscious part. It seemed they had told him Mr. Andrew Greig was
not really dead, but back in France and possessed of an elixir of youth
which could make the ancient and furrowed hills themselves look like
yesterday's creations.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! M. Andrew!&rdquo; he had cried. &ldquo;An elixir of grease were more in the
fellow's line; I have never seen a man's viands give so scurvy a return
for the attention he paid them. 'Tis a pole&mdash;this M. Andrew&mdash;but
what a head&mdash;what a head!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! but 'tis true of the elixir,&rdquo; they protested; &ldquo;and he looks thirty
years younger; here he comes!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was then that I stepped in with the servant bawling my name, and the
priest surged to his feet with his face all quivering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! M. Andrew!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;fattened and five-and-twenty. Holy Mother!
It is, then, that miracles are possible? I shall have a hogshead, master,
of thine infernal essence and drink away this paunch, and skip anon like
to the goats of&mdash;of-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And then his friends burst into peals of laughter as much at my
bewilderment as at his credulity, and he saw that it was all a pleasantry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; he said, sighing like a November forest. &ldquo;There was never more
pestilent gleek played upon a wretched man. Oh! oh! oh! I had an angelic
dream for that moment of your entrance, for I saw me again a stripling&mdash;a
stripling&mdash;and the girl's name was&mdash;never mind. God rest her!
she is under grass in Louvain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
All the rest of the day&mdash;at Clancarty's, at the Café de la Poste, in
our walk along the dunes where cannon were being fired at marks well out
at sea, this obese cleric scarcely let his eyes off me. He seemed to envy
and admire, and then again he would appear to muse upon my countenance,
debating with himself as one who stands at a shop window pondering a
purchase that may be on the verge of his means.
</p>
<p>
Captain Thurot observed his interest, and took an occasion to whisper to
me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have a care, M. Greig,&rdquo; said he playfully; &ldquo;this priest schemes
something; that's ever the worst of your Jesuits, and you may swear 'tis
not your eternal salvation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
'Twas that afternoon we went all together to the curious lodging in the
Rue de la Boucherie. I remember as it had been yesterday how sunny was the
weather, and how odd it seemed to me that there should be a country-woman
of my own there.
</p>
<p>
She was not, as it seems to me now, lovely, though where her features
failed of perfection it would beat me to disclose, but there was something
inexpressibly fascinating in her&mdash;in the mild, kind, melting eyes,
and the faint sad innuendo of her smile. She sat at a spinet playing, and
for the sake of this poor exile, sang some of the songs we are acquainted
with at home. Upon my word, the performance touched me to the core! I felt
sick for home: my mother's state, the girl at Kirkillstane, the dead lad
on the moor, sounds of Earn Water, clouds and heather on the hill of
Ballageich&mdash;those mingled matters swept through my thoughts as I sat
with these blithe gentlemen, hearkening to a simple Doric tune, and my
eyes filled irrestrainably with tears.
</p>
<p>
Miss Walkinshaw&mdash;for so her name was&mdash;saw what effect her music
had produced; reddened, ceased her playing, took me to the window while
the others discussed French poetry, and bade me tell her, as we looked out
upon the street, all about myself and of my home. She was, perhaps, ten
years my senior, and I ran on like a child.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Mearns!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear! And you come frae the Meams!&rdquo;
 She dropped into her Scots that showed her heart was true, and told me she
had often had her May milk in my native parish.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you maybe know,&rdquo; said she, flushing, &ldquo;the toun of Glasgow, and the
house of Walkinshaw, my&mdash;my father, there?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I knew the house very well, but no more of it than that it existed.
</p>
<p>
It was in her eyes the tears were now, talking of her native place, but
she quickly changed the topic ere I could learn much about her, and she
guessed&mdash;with a smile coming through her tears, like a sun through
mist&mdash;that I must have been in love and wandered in its fever, to be
so far from home at my age.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There was a girl,&rdquo; I said, my face hot, my heart rapping at the
recollection, and someway she knew all about Isobel Fortune in five
minutes, while the others in the room debated on so trivial a thing as the
songs of the troubadours.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Isobel Fortune!&rdquo; she said (and I never thought the name so beautiful as
it sounded on her lips, where it lingered like a sweet); &ldquo;Isobel Fortune;
why, it's an omen, Master Greig, and it must be a good fortune. I am wae
for the poor lassie that her big foolish lad&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled with
bewitching sympathy at me under long lashes&mdash;&ldquo;should be so far away
frae her side. You must go back as quick as you can; but stay now, is it
true you love her still?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The woman would get the feeling and the truth from a heart of stone; I
only sighed for answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you'll go back,&rdquo; said she briskly, &ldquo;and it will be Earn-side again
and trysts at Ballageich&mdash;oh! the name is like a bagpipe air to me!&mdash;and
you will be happy, and be married and settle down&mdash;and&mdash;and poor
Clemie Walkinshaw will be friendless far away from her dear Scotland, but
not forgetting you and your wife.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot go back there at all,&rdquo; I said, with a long face, bitter enough,
you may be sure, at the knowledge I had thrown away all that she depicted,
and her countenance fell.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What for no'?&rdquo; she asked softly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because I fought a duel with the man that Isobel preferred, and&mdash;and&mdash;killed
him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She shuddered with a little sucking in of air at her teeth and drew up her
shoulders as if chilled with cold.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the best thing's to forget. Are you a Jacobite,
Master Greig?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She had set aside my love affair and taken to politics with no more than a
sigh of sympathy, whether for the victim of my jealousy, or Isobel
Fortune, or for me, I could not say.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm neither one thing nor another,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;My father is a staunch
enough royalist, and so, I daresay, I would be too if I had not got a
gliff of bonnie Prince Charlie at the Tontine of Glasgow ten years ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ten years ago!&rdquo; she repeated, staring abstracted out at the window. &ldquo;Ten
years ago! So it was; I thought it was a lifetime since. And what did you
think of him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Whatever my answer might have been it never got the air, for here
Clancarty, who had had a message come to the door for him, joined us at
the window, and she turned to him with some phrase about the trampling of
troops that passed along the streets.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the affair marches quickly. Have you heard that England
has declared war? And our counter declaration is already on its way
across. <i>Pardieu!</i> there shall be matters toward in a month or two
and the Fox will squeal. Braddock's affair in America has been the best
thing that has happened us in many years.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thus he went on with singular elation that did not escape me, though my
wits were also occupied by some curious calculations as to what disturbed
the minds of Hamilton and of the lady. I felt that I was in the presence
of some machinating influences probably at variance, for while Clancarty
and Roscommon and Thurot were elate, the priest made only a pretence at
it, and was looking all abstracted as if weightier matters occupied his
mind, his large fat hand, heavy-ringed, buttressing his dewlap, and Miss
Walkinshaw was stealing glances of inquiry at him&mdash;glances of inquiry
and also of distrust. All this I saw in a mirror over the mantelpiece of
the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sure there's but one thing to regret in it,&rdquo; cried Clancarty suddenly,
stopping and turning to me, &ldquo;it must mean that we lose Monsieur des
Souliers Rouges. <i>Peste!</i> There is always something to worry one
about a war!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Comment?</i>&rdquo; said Thurot.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The deportment,&rdquo; answered his lordship. &ldquo;Every English subject has been
ordered out of France. We are going to lose not only your company, Father
Hamilton, because of your confounded hare-brained scheme for covering all
Europe in a glass coach, but our M. Greig must put the Sleeve between him
and those best qualified to estimate and esteem his thousand virtues of
head and heart For a <i>louis</i> or two I'd take ship with him and fight
on the other side. Gad! it would always be fighting anyway, and one would
be by one's friend.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The priest's jaw fell as if my going was a blow to his inmost affections;
he turned his face rapidly into shadow; Miss Walkinshaw lost no movement
of his; she was watching him as he had been a snake.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! but it is not necessary that we lose my compatriot so fast as that,&rdquo;
 she said. &ldquo;There are such things as permits, excepting English friends of
ours from deportment,&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I fancy I could get one
for Mr. Greig.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In my heart I thanked her for her ready comprehension of my inability to
go back to Britain with an easy mind; and I bowed my recognition of her
goodness.
</p>
<p>
She was paying no heed to my politeness; she had again an eye on the
priest, who was obviously cheered marvellously by the prospect.
</p>
<p>
And then we took a dish of tea with her, the lords and Thurot loudly
cheerful, Hamilton ruminant and thundering alternately, Miss Walkinshaw
showing a score of graces as hostess, myself stimulated to some unusual
warmth of spirit as I sat beside her, well-nigh fairly loving her because
she was my country-woman and felt so fond about my native Mearns.

CHAPTER XV
</h2>
<h3>
WHEREIN A SITUATION OFFERS AND I ENGAGE TO GO TRAVELLING WITH THE PRIEST
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> week passed with no further incident particularly affecting this
history. With my reduced and antique mentor I studied <i>la belle langue</i>,
sedulous by day, at night pacing the front of the sea, giving words to its
passion as it broke angry on the bar or thundered on the beach&mdash;the
sea that still haunts me and invites, whose absence makes often lonely the
moorland country where is my home, where are my people's graves. It called
me then, in the dripping weather of those nights in France&mdash;it called
me temptingly to try again my Shoes of Fortune (as now I named them to
myself), and learn whereto they might lead.
</p>
<p>
But in truth I was now a prisoner to that inviting sea. The last English
vessel had gone; the Channel was a moat about my native isle, and I was a
tee'd ball with a passport that was no more and no less than a warder's
warrant in my pouch. It had come to me under cover of Thurot two days
after Miss Walkinshaw's promise; it commanded <i>tous les gouverneurs et
tous les lieutenants-généraux de nos provinces et de nos armées,
gouverneurs particuliers et commandants de nos villes, places et troupes</i>
to permit and pass the Sieur Greig anywhere in the country, <i>sans lui
donner aucun empêchement</i>, and was signed for the king by the Duc de
Choiseuil.
</p>
<p>
I went round to make my devoirs to the lady to whom I owed the favour, and
this time I was alone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where's your shoon, laddie?&rdquo; said she at the first go-off. &ldquo;Losh! do ye
no' ken that they're the very makin' o' ye? If it hadna been for them
Clementina Walkinshaw wad maybe never hae lookit the gait ye were on.
Ye'll be to put them on again!&rdquo; She thrust forth a <i>bottine</i> like a
doll's for size and trod upon my toes, laughing the while with her curious
suggestion of unpractised merriment at my first solemn acceptance of her
humour as earnest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I never to get quit o' thae shoes?&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;the very deil maun be in
them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was the very deil,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;was in them when it was your Uncle
Andrew.&rdquo; And she stopped and sighed. &ldquo;O Andy Greig, Andy Greig! had I been
a wise woman and ta'en a guid-hearted though throughither Mearns man's
advice&mdash;toots! laddie, I micht be a rudas auld wife by my preachin'.
Oh, gie's a sang, or I'll dee.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And then she flew to the spinet (a handsome instrument singularly out of
keeping with the rest of the plenishing in that odd lodging in the Rue de
la Boucherie of Dunkerque), and touched a prelude and broke into an air.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
To-day they call that woman lost and wicked; I have seen it said in
books: God's pity on her! she was not bad; she was the very football of
fate, and a heart of the yellow gold. If I was warlock or otherwise had
charms, I would put back the dial two score years and wrench her from
her chains.

O waly, waly up the bank,
O waly, waly doon the brae.
And waly, waly yon burn-side,
Where I and my love wont to gae.
I leaned my back unto an aik,
I thocht it was a trusty tree,
But first it bowed and syne it brak,
Sae my true love did lichtly me.
</pre>
<p>
They have their own sorrow even in script those ballad words of an exile
like herself, but to hear Miss Walkinshaw sing them was one of the saddest
things I can recall in a lifetime that has known many sorrows. And still,
though sad, not wanting in a sort of brave defiance of calumny, a hope,
and an unchanging affection. She had a voice as sweet as a bird in the
thicket at home; she had an eye full and melting; her lips, at the
sentiment, sometimes faintly broke.
</p>
<p>
I turned my head away that I might not spy upon her feeling, for here, it
was plain, was a tragedy laid bare. She stopped her song mid-way with a
laugh, dashed a hand across her eyes, and threw herself into a chair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, fie! Mr. Greig, to be backing up a daft woman, old enough to know
better, in her vapours. You must be fancying I am a begrutten bairn to be
snackin' my daidlie in this lamentable fashion, but it's just you and your
Mearns, and your Ballageich, and your douce Scots face and tongue that
have fair bewitched me. O Scotland! Scotland! Let us look oot at this
France o' theirs, Mr. Greig.&rdquo; She came to the window (her movements were
ever impetuous, like the flight of a butterfly), and &ldquo;Do I no' wish that
was the Gallowgate,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and Glasgow merchants were in the shops
and Christian signs abin the doors, like 'MacWhannal' and 'Mackay,' and
'Robin Oliphant'? If that was Bailie John Walkinshaw, wi' his rattan, and
yon was the piazza o' Tontine, would no' his dochter be the happy woman?
Look! look! ye Mearns man, look! look! at the bairn playing pal-al in the
close. 'Tis my little sister Jeanie that's married on the great Doctor
Doig&mdash;him wi' the mant i' the Tron kirk&mdash;and bairns o' her ain,
I'm tell't, and they'll never hear their Aunt Clemie named but in a
whisper. And yon auld body wi' the mob cap, that's the baxter's widow, and
there's carvie in her scones that you'll can buy for a bawbee apiece.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The maddest thing!&mdash;but here was the woman smiling through her tears,
and something tremulous in her as though her heart was leaping at her
breast. Suddenly her manner changed, as if she saw a sobering sight, and I
looked out again, and there was Father Hamilton heaving round the corner
of a lane, his face as red as the moon in a fog of frost.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Miss Walkinshaw, &ldquo;here's France, sure enough, Mr. Greig. We
must put by our sentiments, and be just witty or as witty as we can be. If
you're no' witty here, my poor Mr. Greig, you might as well be dumb. A
heart doesna maitter much; but, oh! be witty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The priest was making for the house. She dried her tears before me, a
frankness that flattered my vanity; &ldquo;and let us noo to our English, Mr.
Greig,&rdquo; said she as the knock came to the door. &ldquo;It need be nae honest
Scots when France is chappin'. Would you like to travel for a season?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The question took me by surprise; it had so little relevance to what had
gone before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Travel?&rdquo; I repeated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Travel,&rdquo; said she again quickly. &ldquo;In a glass coach with a companion who
has plenty of money&mdash;wherever it comes from&mdash;and see all Europe,
and maybe&mdash;for you are Scots like myself&mdash;make money. The fat
priest wants a secretary; that's the long and the short of it, for there's
his foot on the stairs, and if you'll say yes, I fancy I can get you the
situation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I did not hesitate a second.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, then yes, to be sure,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and thank you kindly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank <i>you</i>, Paul Greig,&rdquo; said she softly, for now the Swiss had
opened the door, and she squeezed my wrist.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Benedicite!</i>&rdquo; cried his reverence and came in, puffing hugely after
his climb, his face now purple almost to strangulation. &ldquo;May the devil fly
away with turnpike stairs, Madame!&mdash;puff-puff&mdash;I curse them
whether they be wood or marble;&mdash;puff-puff&mdash;I curse them
Dunkerque; in Ostend, Paris, all Europe itself, ay even unto the two
Americas. I curse their designers, artisans, owners, and defenders in
their waking and sleeping! Madame, kindly consider your stairs anathema!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You need all your wind to cool your porridge, as we say in Scotland,
Father Hamilton,&rdquo; cried Miss Walkinshaw, &ldquo;and a bonny-like thing it is to
have you coming here blackguarding my honest stairs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He laughed enormously and fell into a chair, shaking the house as if the
world itself had quaked. &ldquo;Pardon, my dear Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; said he when
his breath was restored, &ldquo;but, by the Mass, you must confess 'tis the
deuce and all for a man&mdash;a real man that loves his viands, and sleeps
well o' nights, and has a contented mind and grows flesh accordingly, to
trip up to Paradise&mdash;&rdquo; here he bowed, his neck swelling in massive
folds&mdash;&ldquo;to trip up to Paradise, where the angels are, as easily as a
ballet-dancer&mdash;bless her!&mdash;skips to the other place where, by my
faith! I should like to pay a brief visit myself, if 'twere only to see
old friends of the Opéra Comique. Madame, I give you good-day. Sir,
Monsieur Greig&mdash;'shalt never be a man like thine Uncle Andrew for all
thy confounded elixir. I favour not your virtuous early rising in the
young. There! thine uncle would a-been abed at this hour an' he were alive
and in Dunkerque; thou must be a confoundedly industrious and sober Greig
to be dangling at a petticoat-tail&mdash;Pardon, Madame, 'tis the dearest
tail, anyway!&mdash;before the hour meridian.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this is France,&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;Here's your papistical gospeller at
home!&rdquo; I minded of the Rev. Scipio Walker in the kirk of Mearns, an image
ever of austerity, waling his words as they had come from Solomon,
groaning even-on for man's eternal doom.
</p>
<p>
The priest quickly comprehended my surprise at his humour, and laughed the
more at that till a fit of coughing choked him. &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;our Andy reincarnate is an Andy most pestilent dull, or I'm a cockle, a
convoluted cockle, and uncooked at that. Why, man! cheer up, thou <i>croque
mort</i>, thou lanthorn-jaw, thou veal-eye, thou melancholious eater of
oaten-meal!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a humblin' sicht!&rdquo; said I. The impertinence was no sooner uttered
than I felt degraded that I should have given it voice, for here was a
priest of God, however odd to my thinking, and, what was more, a man who
might in years have been my father.
</p>
<p>
But luckily it could never then, or at any other time, be said of Father
Hamilton that he was thin-skinned. He only laughed the more at me.
&ldquo;Touche!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I knew I could prick the old Andy somewhere. Still,
Master Paul, thine uncle was not so young as thou, my cockerel. Had seen
his world and knew that Scotland and its&mdash;what do you call them?&mdash;its
manses, did not provide the universal ensample of true piety.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not think, Father Hamilton,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that piety troubled him very
much, or his shoes had not been so well known in Dunkerque.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Miss Walkinshaw laughed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There you are, Father Hamilton!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You'll come little speed with
a man from the Mearns moors unless you take him a little more seriously.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Father Hamilton pursed his lips and rubbed down his thighs, an image of
the gross man that would have turned my father's stomach, who always liked
his men lean, clean, and active. He was bantering me, this fat priest of
Dixmunde, but all the time it was with a friendly eye. Thinks I, here's
another legacy of goodwill from my extraordinary uncle!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hast got thy pass yet, Master Dull?&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not so dull, Master Minister, but what I resent the wrong word even in a
joke,&rdquo; I replied, rising to go.
</p>
<p>
Thurot's voice was on the stair now, and Clan-carty's. If they were not to
find their <i>protégé</i> in an undignified war of words with the priest
of Dixmunde, it was time I was taking my feet from there, as the saying
went.
</p>
<p>
But Miss Walkinshaw would not hear of it. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;we
have some business before you go to your ridiculous French&mdash;weary be
on the language that ever I heard <i>Je t'aime</i> in it!&mdash;and how
does the same march with you, Mr. Greig?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know enough of it to thank my good friends in,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but that must
be for another occasion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Father Hamilton,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;here's your secretary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A curious flash came to those eyes pitted in rolls of flabby flesh, I
thought of an eagle old and moulting, languid upon a mountain cliff in
misty weather, catching the first glimpse of sun and turned thereby to
ancient memories. He said nothing; there was at the moment no opportunity,
for the visitors had entered, noisily polite and posturing as was their
manner, somewhat touched by wine, I fancied, and for that reason scarcely
welcomed by the mistress of the house.
</p>
<p>
There could be no more eloquent evidence of my innocence in these days
than was in the fact that I never wondered at the footing upon which these
noisy men of the world were with a countrywoman of mine. The cause they
often spoke of covered many mysteries; between the Rue de Paris and the
Rue de la Boucherie I could have picked out a score of Scots in exile for
their political faiths, and why should not Miss Walkinshaw be one of the
company? But sometimes there was just the faintest hint of over-much
freedom in their manner to her, and that I liked as little as she seemed
to do, for when her face flushed and her mouth firmed, and she became
studiously deaf, I felt ashamed of my sex, and could have retorted had not
prudence dictated silence as the wisest policy.
</p>
<p>
As for her, she was never but the minted metal, ringing true and decent,
compelling order by a glance, gentle yet secure in her own strength,
tolerant, but in bounds.
</p>
<p>
They were that day full of the project for invading England. It had gone
so far that soldiers at Calais and Boulogne were being practised in
embarkation. I supposed she must have a certain favour for a step that was
designed to benefit the cause wherefor I judged her an exile, but she
laughed at the idea of Britain falling, as she said, to a parcel of <i>crapauds</i>.
&ldquo;Treason!&rdquo; treason!&rdquo; cried Thurot laughingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Under the circumstances, Madame&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;Under the circumstances, Captain Thurot,&rdquo; she interrupted quickly,
&ldquo;I need not pretend at a lie. This is not in the Prince's interest, this
invasion, and it is a blow at a land I love. Mr. Greig here has just put
it into my mind how good are the hearts there, how pleasant the tongue,
and how much I love the very name of Scotland. I would be sorry to think
of its end come to pleasure the women in Versailles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bravo! bravo! <i>vive la bagatelle!</i>&rdquo; cried my Lord Clancarty. &ldquo;Gad! I
sometimes feel the right old pathriot myself. Sure I have a good mind&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then 'tis not your own, my lord,&rdquo; she cried quickly, displeasure in her
expression, and Clancarty only bowed, not a whit abashed at the sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
Father Hamilton drew me aside from these cheerful contentions, and plunged
into the matter that was manifestly occupying all his thoughts since Miss
Walkinshaw had mooted me as his secretary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur Greig,&rdquo; he said, placing his great carcase between me and the
others in the room, &ldquo;I declare that women are the seven plagues, and yet
here we come chasing them from <i>petit lever</i> till&mdash;till&mdash;well,
till as late as the darlings will let us. By the Mass and Father Hamilton
knows their value, and when a man talks to me about a woman and the love
he bears her, I think 'tis a maniac shouting the praise of the snake that
has crept to his breast to sting him. Women&mdash;chut!&mdash;now tell me
what the mischief is a woman an' thou canst.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I fancy, Father Hamilton,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you could be convinced of the merits
of woman if your heart was ever attacked by one&mdash;your heart, that
does not believe anything in that matter that emanates from your head.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Again the eagle's gleam from the pitted eyes; and, upon my word, a sigh!
It was a queer man this priest of Dixmunde.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, young cockerel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou knowest nothing at all about it, and
as for me&mdash;well, I dare not; but once&mdash;once&mdash;once there
were dews in the woods, and now it is very dry weather, Master Greig. How
about thine honour's secretaryship? Gripp'st at the opportunity, young
fellow? Eh? Has the lady said sooth? Come now, I like the look of my old
Andrew's&mdash;my old Merry Andrew's nephew, and could willingly tolerate
his <i>croque-mort</i> countenance, his odour of the sanctuary, if he
could weather it with a plethoric good liver that takes the world as he
finds it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He was positively eager to have me. It was obvious from his voice. He took
me by the button of my lapel as if I were about to run away from his
offer, but I was in no humour to run away. Here was the very office I
should have chosen if a thousand offered. The man was a fatted sow to look
on, and by no means engaging in his manner to myself, but what was I and
what my state that I should be too particular? Here was a chance to see
the world&mdash;and to forget. Seeing the world might have been of most
importance some months ago in the mind of a clean-handed young lad in the
parish of Mearns in Scotland, but now it was of vastly more importance
that I should forget.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We start in a week,&rdquo; said the priest, pressing me closely lest I should
change my mind, and making the prospects as picturesque as he could. &ldquo;Why
should a man of flesh and blood vex his good stomach with all this
babblement of king's wars? and a pox on their flat-bottomed boats! I have
seen my last Mass in Dixmunde; say not a word on that to our friends nor
to Madame; and I suffer from a very jaundice of gold. Is't a pact, friend
Scotland?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A pact it was; I went out from Miss Walkinshaw's lodging that afternoon
travelling secretary to the fat priest.

CHAPTER XVI
</h2>
<h3>
RELATES HOW I INDULGED MY CURIOSITY AND HOW LITTLE CAME OF IT
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>unkerque in these days (it may be so no longer) was a place for a man to
go through with his nose in his fingers. Garbage stewed and festered in
the gutters of the street so that the women were bound to walk
high-kilted, and the sea-breeze at its briskest scarcely sufficed to stir
the stagnant, stenching atmosphere of the town, now villainously
over-populated by the soldiery with whom it was France's pleasant delusion
she should whelm our isle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i>&rdquo; cried Father Hamilton, as we emerged in this malodorous
open, &ldquo;'twere a fairy godfather's deed to clear thee out of this feculent
cloaca. Think on't, boy; of you and me a week hence riding through the
sweet woods of Somme or Oise, and after that Paris! Paris! my lad of
tragedy; Paris, where the world moves and folk live. And then, perhaps,
Tours, and Bordeaux, and Flanders, and Sweden, Seville, St. Petersburg
itself, but at least the woods of Somme, where the roads are among
gossamer and dew and enchantment in the early morning&mdash;if we cared to
rise early enough to see them, which I promise thee we shall not.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His lips were thick and trembling: he gloated as he pictured me this mad
itinerary, leaning heavily on my arm&mdash;Silenus on an ash sapling&mdash;half-trotting
beside me, looking up every now and then to satisfy himself I appreciated
the prospect. It was pleasant enough, though in a measure incredible, but
at the moment I was thinking of Miss Walkinshaw, and wondering much to
myself that this exposition of foreign travel should seem barely
attractive because it meant a severance from her. Her sad smile, her brave
demeanour, her kind heart, her beauty had touched me sensibly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Master Scrivener!&rdquo; cried the priest, panting at my side, &ldquo;art
dumb?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I fancy, sir, it is scarcely the weather for woods,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I hope we
are not to put off our journey till the first of April a twelvemonth.&rdquo; A
suspicion unworthy of me had flashed into my mind that I might, after all,
be no more than the butt of a practical joke. But that was merely for a
moment; the priest was plainly too eager on his scheme to be play-acting
it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am very grateful to the lady,&rdquo; I hastened to add, &ldquo;who gave me the
chance of listing in your service. Had it not been for her you might have
found a better secretary, and I might have remained long enough in the
evil smells of Dunkerque that I'll like all the same in spite of that,
because I have so good a friend as Miss Walkinshaw in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;La! la! la!&rdquo; cried out Father Hamilton, squeezing my arm. &ldquo;Here's our
young cockerel trailing wing already! May I never eat fish again if
'tisn't a fever in this woman that she must infect every man under three
score. For me I am within a month of the period immune, and only feel a
malaise in her company. Boy, perpend! Have I not told thee every woman,
except the ugliest, is an agent of the devil? I am the first to discover
that his majesty is married and his wife keeps shop when he is travelling&mdash;among
Jesuits and Jacobites and such busy fuel for the future fires. His wife
keeps shop, lad, and does a little business among her own sex, using the
handsomest for her purposes. Satan comes back to the <i>boutique</i>.
'What!' he cries, and counts the till, 'these have been busy days, good
wife.' And she, Madame Dusky, chuckles with a 'Ha! Jack, old man, hast a
good wife or not? Shalt never know how to herd in souls like sheep till
thou hast a quicker eye for what's below a Capuchin hood.' This&mdash;this
is a sweet woman, this Walkinshaw, Paul, but a dangerous. 'Ware hawk, lad,
'ware hawk!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I suppose my face reddened at that; at least he looked at me again and
pinched, and &ldquo;Smitten to the marrow; may I drink water and grow thin else.
<i>Sacré nom de nom!</i> 'tis time thou wert on the highways of Europe.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How does it happen that a countrywoman of mine is here alone?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll be shot if thou art not the rascalliest young innocent in France.
Aye! or out of Scotland,&rdquo; cried Father Hamilton, holding his sides for
laughter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is thy infernal climate of fogs and rains so pleasant that a woman of
spirit should abide there for ever an' she have the notion to travel
otherwheres? La! la! la! Master Scrivener, and thou must come to an honest
pious priest for news of the world. But, boy, I'm deaf and dumb; mine eyes
on occasion are without vision. Let us say the lady has been an
over-ardent Jacobite; 'twill suffice in the meantime. And now has't ever
set eyes on Charles Edward?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I told him I had never had any hand in the Jacobite affairs, if that was
what he meant.
</p>
<p>
His countenance fell at that.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, losing his Roman manner, &ldquo;do you tell me you have never
seen him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But once, I explained, when he marched into Glasgow city with his wild
Highlanders and bullied the burgesses into providing shoes for his ragged
army.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he with a clearing visage, &ldquo;that will suffice. Must point him
out to me. Dixmunde parish was a poor place for seeing the great; 'tis why
I go wandering now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Father Hamilton's hint at politics confirmed my guess about Miss
Walkinshaw, but I suppose I must have been in a craze to speak of her on
any pretence, for later in the day I was at Thurot's lodging, and there
must precognosce again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Oh, mon Dieu, quelle espièglerie!</i>&rdquo; cried out the captain. &ldquo;And
this a Greig too! Well, I do not wonder that your poor uncle stayed so
long away from home; faith, he'd have died of an <i>ennui</i> else. Miss
Walkinshaw is&mdash;Miss Walkinshaw; a countryman of her own should know
better than I all that is to be known about her. But 'tis not our affair,
Mr. Greig. For sure 'tis enough that we find her smiling, gentle,
tolerant, what you call the 'perfect lady'&mdash;<i>n'est ce pas?</i>And
of all the virtues, upon my word, kindness is the best and rarest, and
that she has to a miracle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm thinking that is not a corsair's creed, Captain Thurot,&rdquo; said I,
smiling at the gentleman's eagerness. He was standing over me like a
lighthouse, with his eyes on fire, gesturing with his arms as they had
been windmill sails.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, faith! but 'tis a man's, Master Greig, and I have been happy with it.
Touching our fair friend, I may say that, much as I admire her, I agree
with some others that ours were a luckier cause without her. Gad! the best
thing you could do, Mr. Greig, would be to marry her yourself and take her
back with you to Scotland.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! byway of Paris in Father Hamilton's glass coach,&rdquo; I said, bantering
to conceal my confusion at such a notion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;H'm,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Father Hamilton and the lady are a pair.&rdquo; He walked a
little up and down the room as if he were in a quandary. &ldquo;A pair,&rdquo; he
resumed. &ldquo;I fancied I could see to the very centre of the Sphinx itself,
for all men are in ourselves if we only knew it, till I came upon this
Scotswoman and this infernal Flemish-English priest of Dix-munde. Somehow,
for them Antoine Thurot has not the key in himself yet. Still, 'twill
arrive, 'twill arrive! I like the lady&mdash;and yet I wish she were a
thousand miles away; I like the man too, but a Jesuit is too many men at
once to be sure of; and, Gad! I can scarcely sleep at nights for wondering
what he may be plotting. This grand tour of his-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; I cried, in a fear that he might compromise himself in an
ignorance of my share in the tour in question; &ldquo;I must tell you that I am
going with Father Hamilton as his secretary, although it bothers me to
know what scrivening is to be accomplished in a glass coach. Like enough I
am to be no more, in truth, than the gentleman's companion or courier, and
it is no matter so long as I am moving.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, and is it so?&rdquo; cried Captain Thurot, stopping as if he had been
shot. &ldquo;And how happens it that this priest is willing to take you, that
are wholly a foreigner and a stranger to the country?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Walkinshaw recommended me,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you have not been long of getting into your excellent
countrywoman's kind favour. Is it that Tony Thurot has been doing the
handsome by an ingrate? No, no, Monsieur, that were a monstrous innuendo,
for the honour has been all mine. But that Miss Walkinshaw should be on
such good terms with the priest as to trouble with the provision of his
secretary is opposed to all I had expected of her. Why, she dislikes the
man, or I'm a stuffed fish.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anyhow, she has done a handsome thing by me,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is no wonder
that so good a heart as hers should smother its repugnances (and the
priest is a fat sow, there is no denying) for the sake of a poor lad from
its own country. You are but making it the plainer that I owe her more
than at first I gave her credit for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bless me, here's gratitude!&rdquo; cried the captain, laughing at my warmth.
&ldquo;Mademoiselle Walkinshaw has her own plans; till now, I fancied them
somewhat different from Hamilton's, but more fool I to fancy they were
what they seemed! All that, my dear lad, need not prevent your enjoying
your grand tour with the priest, who has plenty of money and the
disposition to spend it like a gentleman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Finally I went to my Lord Clancarty, for it will be observed that I had
still no hint as to the origin of the lady who was so good a friend of
mine. Though the last thing in the world I should have done was to pry
into her affairs for the indulgence of an idle curiosity, I would know the
best of her before the time came to say farewell, and leave of her with me
no more than a memory.
</p>
<p>
The earl was at the Café du Soleil d'Or, eating mussels on the terrace and
tossing the empty shells into the gutter what time he ogled passing women
and exchanged levitous repartee with some other frequenters of the place.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad, Paul,&rdquo; he cried, meeting me with effusion, &ldquo;'tis said there is one
pearl to be found for every million mussels; but here's a pearl come to me
in the midst of a single score. An Occasion, lad; I sat at the dice last
night till a preposterous hour this morning, and now I have a headache
like the deuce and a thirst to take the Baltic. I must have the tiniest
drop, and on an Occasion too. <i>Voilà! Gaspard, une autre bouteille.</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He had his bottle, that I merely made pretence to help him empty, and I
had my precognition.
</p>
<p>
But it came to little in the long run. Oh yes, he understood my interest
in the lady (with rakish winking); 'twas a delicious creature for all its
<i>hauteur</i> when one ventured a gallantry, but somehow no particular
friend to the Earl of Clancarty, who, if she only knew it, was come of as
noble a stock as any rotten Scot ever went unbreeched; not but what (this
with a return of the naturally polite man) there were admirable and
high-bred people of that race, as instance my Uncle Andrew and myself. But
was there any reason why such a man as Charlie Stuart should be King of
Ireland? &ldquo;I say, Greig, blister the old Chevalier and his two sons! There
is not a greater fumbler on earth than this sotted person, who has drunk
the Cause to degradation and would not stir a hand to serve me and my
likes, that are, begad! the fellow's betters.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But all this,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has little to do with Miss Walkinshaw. I have
nothing to say of the Prince, who may be all you say, though that is not
the repute he has in Scotland.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bravo, Mr. Greig!&rdquo; cried his lordship. &ldquo;That is the tone if you would
keep in the lady's favour. Heaven knows she has little reason to listen to
praise of such a creature, but, then, women are blind. She loves not
Clancarty, as I have said; but, no matter, I forgive her that; 'tis well
known 'tis because I cannot stomach her prince.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you must interest yourself in these Jacobite affairs
and mix with all that are here of that party.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith and I do,&rdquo; he confessed heartily. &ldquo;What! am I to be a mole and stay
underground? A man must have his diversion, and though I detest the Prince
I love his foolish followers. Do you know what, Mr. Greig? 'Tis the
infernal irony of things in this absurd world that the good fellows, the
bloods, the men of sensibilities must for ever be wrapped up in poor mad
escapades and emprises. And a Clancarty is ever of such a heart that the
more madcap the scheme the more will he dote on it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A woman passing in a chair at this moment looked in his direction;
fortunately, otherwise I was condemned to a treatise on life and pleasure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there's a face that's like a line of song,&rdquo; and he
smiled at her with unpardonable boldness as it seemed to me, a pleasant
pucker about his eyes, a hint of the good comrade in his mouth.
</p>
<p>
She flushed like wine and tried to keep from smiling, but could not
resist, and smiling she was borne away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know her, my lord?&rdquo; I could not forbear asking.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it know her?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Devil a know, but 'tis a woman anyhow, and a
heart at that. Now who the deuce can she be?&rdquo; And he proceeded, like a
true buck, to fumble with the Mechlin of his fall and dust his stockings
in an airy foppish manner so graceful that I swear no other could have
done the same so well.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now this Miss Walkinshaw&mdash;&rdquo; I went on, determined to have some
satisfaction from my interview.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Confound your Miss Walkinshaw, by your leave, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; he interrupted.
&ldquo;Can you speak of Miss Walkinshaw when the glory of the comet is still
trailing in the heavens? And&mdash;hum!&mdash;I mind me of a certain
engagement, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; he went on hurriedly, drawing a horologe from his
fob and consulting it with a frowning brow. &ldquo;In the charm of your
conversation I had nigh forgot, so <i>adieu, adieu, mon ami!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He gave me the tips of his fingers, and a second later he was gone,
stepping down the street with a touch of the minuet, tapping his legs with
his cane, his sword skewering his coat-skirts, all the world giving him
the cleanest portion of the thoroughfare and looking back after him with
envy and admiration.

CHAPTER XVII
</h2>
<h3>
WITNESSES THE LAST OF A BLATE YOUNG MAN
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd all this time it may well be wondered where was my remorse for a shot
fired on the moor of Mearns, for two wretched homes created by my passion
and my folly. And where, in that shifting mind of mine, was the place of
Isobel Fortune, whose brief days of favour for myself (if that, indeed,
was not imagination on my part) had been the cause of these my wanderings?
There is one beside me as I write, ready to make allowance for youth and
ignorance, the untutored affection, the distraught mind, if not for the
dubiety as to her feelings for myself when I was outlawed for a deed of
blood and had taken, as the Highland phrase goes, the world for my pillow.
</p>
<p>
I did not forget the girl of Kirkillstane; many a time in the inward
visions of the night, and of the day too, I saw her go about that far-off
solitary house in the hollow of the hills. Oddly enough, 'twas ever in
sunshine I saw her, with her sun-bonnet swinging from its ribbons and her
hand above her eyes, shading them that she might look across the fields
that lay about her home, or on a tryst of fancy by the side of Earn,
hearing the cushats mourn in a magic harmony with her melancholy thoughts.
As for the killing of young Borland, that I kept, waking at least, from my
thoughts, or if the same intruded, I found it easier, as time passed, to
excuse myself for a fatality that had been in the experience of nearly
every man I now knew&mdash;of Clancarty and Thurot, of the very baker in
whose house I lodged and who kneaded the dough for his little bread not a
whit the less cheerily because his hands had been imbrued.
</p>
<p>
The late Earl of Clare, in France called the Maréchal Comte de Thomond,
had come to Dunkerque in the quality of Inspector-General of the Armies of
France, to review the troops in garrison and along that menacing coast.
The day after my engagement with Father Hamilton I finished my French
lesson early and went to see his lordship and his army on the dunes to the
east of the town. Cannon thundered, practising at marks far out in the
sea; there was infinite manoeuvring of horse and foot; the noon was noisy
with drums and the turf shook below the hoofs of galloping chargers. I
fancy it was a holiday; at least, as I recall the thing, Dunkerque was all
<i>en fête</i>, and a happy and gay populace gathered in the rear of the
maréchales flag. Who should be there among the rest, or rather a little
apart from the crowd, but Miss Walkinshaw! She had come in a chair; her
dainty hand beckoned me to her side almost as soon as I arrived.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, that's what I must allow is very considerate,&rdquo; said she, eyeing my
red shoes, which were put on that day from some notion of proper
splendour.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well considered?&rdquo; I repeated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just well considered,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You know how much it would please me to
see you in your red shoes, and so you must put them on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was young in these days, and, like the ass I was, I quickly set about
disabusing her mind of a misapprehension that injured her nor me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how could I do that when I did not
know you were to be here? You are the last I should have expected to see
here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed, growing very red. &ldquo;Does Mr. Greig trouble himself
so much about the <i>convenances?</i> And why should I not be here if I
have the whim? Tell me that, my fastidious compatriot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Here was an accountable flurry over a thoughtless phrase!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No reason in the world that I know of,&rdquo; said I gawkily, as red as
herself, wondering what it was my foot was in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That you know of,&rdquo; she repeated, as confused as ever. &ldquo;It seems to me,
Mr. Greig, that the old gentleman who is tutoring you in the French
language would be doing a good turn to throw in a little of the manners of
the same. Let me tell you that I am as much surprised as you can be to
find myself here, and now that you are so good as to put me in mind of the&mdash;of
the&mdash;of the <i>convenances</i>, I will go straight away home. It was
not the priest, nor was it Captain Thurot that got your ear, for they are
by the way of being gentlemen; it could only have been this Irishman
Clancarty&mdash;the quality of that country have none of the scrupulosity
that distinguishes our own. You can tell his lordship, next time you see
him, that Miss Walkinshaw will see day about with him for this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She ordered her chairmen to take her home, and then&mdash;burst into
tears!
</p>
<p>
I followed at her side, in a stew at my indiscoverable blundering, my <i>chapeau-de-bras</i>
in my hand, and myself like to greet too for sympathy and vexation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must tell me what I have done, Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Heaven
knows I have few enough friends in this world without losing your good
opinion through an offence of whose nature I am entirely ignorant.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; she said, pushing my fingers from the side of her chair, that
was now being borne towards the town.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, and I shall not, Miss Walkinshaw, asking your pardon for the
freedom,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for here's some monstrous misconception, and I must
clear myself, even at the cost of losing your favour for ever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She hid her face in her handkerchief and paid no more heed to me. Feeling
like a mixture of knave and fool, I continued to walk deliberately by her
side all the way into the Rue de la Boucherie. She dismissed the chair and
was for going into the house without letting an eye light on young
persistency.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;One word, Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; I pleaded. &ldquo;We are a Scottish man and a
Scottish woman, our leelones of all our race at this moment in this
street, and it will be hard-hearted of the Scottish woman if she will not
give her fellow countryman, that has for her a respect and an affection, a
chance to know wherein he may have blundered.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Respect and affection,&rdquo; she said, her profile turned to me, her foot on
the steps, visibly hesitating.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Respect and affection,&rdquo; I repeated, flushing at my own boldness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In spite of Clancarty's tales of me?&rdquo; she said, biting her nether lip and
still manifestly close on tears.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said I, bewildered. &ldquo;His lordship gave me no tales that I know of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;be at such pains to tell me you wondered I should be
there?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I got very red at that.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You see, you cannot be frank with me, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; she said bitterly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; I ventured boldly, &ldquo;what I should have said was that I
feared you would not be there, for it's there I was glad to see you. And I
have only discovered that in my mind since you have been angry with me and
would not let me explain myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she cried, quite radiant, &ldquo;and, after all, the red shoon were not
without a purpose? Oh, Mr. Greig, you're unco' blate! And, to tell you the
truth, I was just play-acting yonder myself. I was only making believe to
be angry wi' you, and now that we understand each ither you can see me to
my parlour.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Bernard,&rdquo; she said to the Swiss as we entered, &ldquo;any news?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He informed her there was none.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! no one called?&rdquo; said she with manifest disappointment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Personne, Madame</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No letters?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Nor were there any letters, he replied.
</p>
<p>
She sighed, paused irresolute a moment with her foot on the stair, one
hand at her heart, the other at the fastening of her coat, and looked at
me with a face almost tragic in its trouble. I cannot but think she was on
the brink of a confidence, but ere it came she changed her mind and dashed
up the stair with a tra-la-la of a song meant to indicate her
indifference, leaving me a while in her parlour while she changed her
dress. She came back to me in a little, attired in a pale
primrose-coloured paduasoy, the cuffs and throat embroidered in a pattern
of roses and leaves, her hair unpowdered and glossy, wantoning in and out
of a neck beyond description. The first thing she did on entrance was odd
enough, for it was to stand over me where I lounged on her settee, staring
down into my eyes until I felt a monstrous embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am wonderin',&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if ye are the man I tak' ye for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Her eyes were moist; I saw she had been crying in her toilet room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm just the man you see,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but for some unco' troubles that are
inside me and are not for airing to my friends on a fine day in
Dunkerque.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps, like the lave of folks, ye dinna ken yoursel',&rdquo; she went on,
speaking with no sprightly humour though in the Scots she was given to
fall to in her moments of fun. &ldquo;All men, Mr. Greig, mean well, but most of
them fall short of their own ideals; they're like the women in that, no
doubt, but in the men the consequence is more disastrous.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When I was a girl in a place you know,&rdquo; she went on even more soberly, &ldquo;I
fancied all men were on the model of honest John Walkinshaw&mdash;better
within than without. He was stern to austerity, demanding the last
particle of duty from his children, and to some he might seem hard, but I
have never met the man yet with a kinder heart, a pleasanter mind, a more
pious disposition than John Walkin-shaw's. It has taken ten years, and
acquaintance with some gentry not of Scotland, to make it plain that all
men are not on his model.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could fancy not, to judge from his daughter,&rdquo; I said, blushing at my
first compliment that was none the less bold because it was sincere.
</p>
<p>
At that she put on a little mouth and shrugged her shoulders with a shiver
that made the snaps in her ears tremble.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My good young man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there you go! If there's to be any
friendship between you and Clementina Walkinshaw, understand there must be
a different key from that. You are not only learning your French, but you
are learning, it would seem, the manners of the nation. It was that made
me wonder if you could be the man I took you for the first day you were in
this room and I found I could make you greet with a Scots sang, and tell
me honestly about a lass you had a notion of and her no' me. That last's
the great stroke of honesty in any man, and let me tell you there are some
women who would not relish it. But you are in a company here so ready with
the tongue of flattery that I doubt each word they utter, and that's droll
enough in me that loves my fellow creatures, and used to think the very
best of every one of them. If I doubt them now I doubt them with a sore
enough heart, I'll warrant you. Oh! am I not sorry that my man of Mearns
should be put in the reverence of such creatures as Clancarty and Thurot,
and all that gang of worldlings? I do not suppose I could make you
understand it, Mr. Paul Greig, but I feel motherly to you, and to see my
son&mdash;this great giant fellow who kens the town of Glasgow and dwelt
in Mearns where I had May milk, and speaks wi' the fine Scots tongue like
mysel' when his heart is true&mdash;to see him the boon comrade with folks
perhaps good enough for Clementina Walkinshaw but lacking a particle of
principle, is a sight to sorrow me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And is it for that you seek to get me away with the priest?&rdquo; I asked,
surprised at all this, and a little resenting the suggestion of youth
implied in her feeling like a mother to me. Her face was lit, her movement
free and beautiful; something in her fascinated me.
</p>
<p>
She dropped in a chair and pushed the hair from her ears with a hand like
milk, and laughed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now how could you guess?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Am I no' the careful mother of you
to put you in the hands o' the clergy? I doubt this play-acting
rhetorician of a man from Dixmunde is no great improvement on the rest of
your company when all's said and done, but you'll be none the worse for
seeing the world at his costs, and being in other company than Clancarty's
and Thurot's and Roscommon's. He told me to-day you were going with him,
and I was glad that I had been of that little service to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then it seems you think so little of my company as to be willing enough
to be rid of me at the earliest opportunity,&rdquo; I said, honestly somewhat
piqued at her readiness to clear me out of Dunkerque.
</p>
<p>
She looked at me oddly. &ldquo;Havers, Mr. Greig!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;just havers!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was thanking her for her offices, but she checked me. &ldquo;You are well
off,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to be away from here while these foolish manouvrings are
on foot. Poor me! I must bide and see them plan the breaking down of my
native country. It's a mercy I know in what a fiasco it will end, this
planning. Hearken! Do you hear the bugles? That's Soubise going back to
the caserne. He and his little men are going back to eat another dinner
destined to assist in the destruction of an island where you and I should
be this day if we were wiser than we are. Fancy them destroying Britain,
Mr. Greig!&mdash;Britain, where honest John Walkinshaw is, that never said
an ill word in his life, nor owed any man a penny: where the folks are
guid and true, and fear God and want nothing but to be left to their
crofts and herds. If it was England&mdash;if it was the palace of Saint
James&mdash;no, but it's Scotland, too, and the men you saw marching up
and down to-day are to be marching over the moor o' Mearns when the
heather's red. Can you think of it?&rdquo; She stamped her foot. &ldquo;Where the wee
thack hooses are at the foot o' the braes, and the bairns playing under
the rowan trees; where the peat is smelling, and the burns are singing in
the glens, and the kirk-bells are ringing. Poor Mr. Greig! Are ye no' wae
for Scotland? Do ye think Providence will let a man like Thomond ye saw
to-day cursing on horseback&mdash;do ye think Providence will let him lead
a French army among the roads you and I ken so well, affronting the people
we ken too, who may be a thought dull in the matter of repartee, but are
for ever decent, who may be hard-visaged, but are so brave?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She laughed, herself, half bitterly, half contemptuously, at the picture
she drew. Outside, in the sunny air of the afternoon, the bugles of
Soubise filled the street with brazen cries, and nearer came the roar of
pounding drums. I thought I heard them menacing the sleep of evening
valleys far away, shattering the calm of the hearth of Hazel Den.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The cause for which&mdash;for which so many are exile here,&rdquo; I said,
looking on this Jacobite so strangely inconsistent, &ldquo;has no reason to
regret that France should plan an attack on Georgius Rex.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She shook her head impatiently. &ldquo;The cause has nothing to do with it, Mr.
Greig,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The cause will suffer from this madness more than ever
it did, but in any case 'tis the most miserable of lost causes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Prince Charlie-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Once it was the cause with me, now I would sooner have it Scotland,&rdquo; she
went on, heedless of my interruption. &ldquo;Scotland! Scotland! Oh, how the
name of her is like a dirge to me, and my heart is sore for her! Where is
your heart, Mr. Greig, that it does not feel alarm at the prospect of
these <i>crapauds</i> making a single night's sleep uneasy for the folks
you know? Where is your heart, I'm asking?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; said I impulsively, staring at her, completely bewitched
by her manner so variable and intense, and the straying tendrils of her
hair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you not?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Then I will tell you. It is where it ought to be&mdash;with
a girl of the name of Isobel Fortune. Oh, the dear name! oh, the sweet
name! And when you are on your travels with this priest do not be
forgetting her. Oh, yes! I know you will tell me again that all is over
between the pair of you, and that she loved another&mdash;but I am not
believing a word of that, Mr. Greig, when I look at you&mdash;(and will ye
say 'thank ye' for the compliment that's there?)&mdash;you will just go on
thinking her the same, and you will be the better man for it. There's
something tells me she is thinking of you though I never saw her, the
dear! Let me see, this is what sort of girl she will be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She drew her chair closer to the settee and leaned forward in front of me,
and, fixing her eyes on mine, drew a picture of the girl of Kirkillstane
as she imagined her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She will be about my own height, and with the same colour of hair-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How do you know that? I never said a word of that to you,&rdquo; I cried,
astonished at the nearness of her first guess.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I'm a witch,&rdquo; she cried triumphantly, &ldquo;a fair witch. Hoots! do I no'
ken ye wadna hae looked the side o' the street I was on if I hadna put ye
in mind o' her? Well, she's my height and colour&mdash;but, alack-a-day,
no' my years. She 'll have a voice like the mavis for sweetness, and 'll
sing to perfection. She'll be shy and forward in turns, accordin' as you
are forward and shy; she 'll can break your heart in ten minutes wi' a
pout o' her lips or mak' ye fair dizzy with delight at a smile. And then&rdquo;&mdash;here
Miss Walkinshaw seemed carried away herself by her fancy portrait, for she
bent her brows studiously as she thought, and seemed to speak in an
abstraction&mdash;&ldquo;and then she'll be a managing woman. She'll be the sort
of woman that the Bible tells of whose value is over rubies; knowing your
needs as you battle with the world, and cheerful when you come in to the
hearthstone from the turmoil outside. A witty woman and a judge of things,
calm but full of fire in your interests. A household where the wife's a
doll is a cart with one wheel, and your Isobel will be the perfect woman.
I think she must have travelled some, too, and seen how poor is the wide
world compared with what is to be found at your own fire-end; I think she
must have had trials and learned to be brave.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She stopped suddenly, looked at me and got very red in the face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A fine picture, Miss Walkinshaw!&rdquo; said I, with something drumming at my
heart. &ldquo;It is not just altogether like Isobel Fortune, who has long syne
forgot but to detest me, but I fancy I know who it is like.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who might that be?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice and with a somewhat
guilty look.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will I tell you?&rdquo; I asked, myself alarmed at my boldness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No! no! never mind,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I was just making a picture of a girl I
once knew&mdash;poor lass! and of what she might have been. But she's dead&mdash;dead
and buried. I hope, after all, your Isobel is a nobler woman than the one
I was thinking on and a happier destiny awaiting her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That cannot matter much to me now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for, as I told you, there is
nothing any more between us&mdash;except&mdash;except a corp upon the
heather.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She shuddered as she did the first time I told her of my tragedy, and
sucked in the air again through her clenched teeth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor lad! poor lad!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And you have quite lost her. If so, and
the thing must be, then this glass coach of Father Hamilton's must take
you to the country of forgetfulness. I wish I could drive there myself
this minute, but wae's me, there's no chariot at the <i>remise</i> that'll
do that business for John Walkinshaw's girl.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Something inexpressively moving was in her mien, all her heart was in her
face as it seemed; a flash of fancy came to me that she was alone in the
world with nothing of affection to hap her round from its abrasions, and
that her soul was crying out for love. Sweet beyond expression was this
woman and I was young; up to my feet I rose, and turned on her a face that
must have plainly revealed my boyish passion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you may put me out of this door for ever, but
I'm bound to say I'm going travelling in no glass coach; Dunkerque will be
doing very well for me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Her lips trembled; her cheek turned pale; she placed a hand upon her
breast, and there was I contrite before her anger!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this&mdash;is this your respect and your esteem, Mr. Greig?&rdquo; she asked
brokenly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They were never greater than at this moment,&rdquo; I replied.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how are they to be manifested by your waiting on in Dunkerque?&rdquo; she
asked, recovering her colour and some of her ordinary manner.
</p>
<p>
How indeed? She had no need to ask me the question, for it was already
ringing through my being. That the Spoiled Horn from Mearns, an outlaw
with blood on his hands and borrowed money in his pocket, should have the
presumption to feel any ardour for this creature seemed preposterous to
myself, and I flushed in an excess of shame and confusion.
</p>
<p>
This seemed completely to reassure her. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Greig&mdash;Mr. Greig,
was I not right to ask if ye were the man ye seemed? Here's a nice display
o' gallantry from my giant son! I believe you are just makin' fun o' this
auld wife; and if no' I hae just one word for you, Paul Greig, and it's
this that I said afore&mdash;jist havers!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She went to her spinet and ran her fingers over the keys and broke into a
song&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Oh, what ails the laddie, new twined frae his mither?
The laddie gallantin' roun' Tibbie and me?&mdash;
</pre>
<p>
with glances coquettish yet repelling round her shoulder at me as I stood
turning my <i>chapeau-de-bras</i> in my hand as a boy turns his bonnet in
presence of laird or dominie. The street was shaking now with the sound of
marching soldiers, whose platoons were passing in a momentary silence of
trumpet or drum. All at once the trumpets blared forth just in front of
the house, broke upon her song, and gave a heavensent diversion to our
comedy or tragedy or whatever it was in the parlour.
</p>
<p>
We both stood looking out at the window for a while in silence, watching
the passing troops, and when the last file had gone, she turned with a
change of topic &ldquo;If these men had been in England ten years ago,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;when brisk affairs were doing there with Highland claymores, your
Uncle Andrew would have been there, too, and it would not perhaps be your
father who was Laird of Hazel Den. But that's all by with now. And when do
you set out with Father Hamilton?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She had a face as serene as fate; my heart ached to tell her that I loved
her, but her manner made me hold my tongue on that.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In three days,&rdquo; I said, still turning my hat and wishing myself
elsewhere, though her presence intoxicated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In three days!&rdquo; she said, as one astonished. &ldquo;I had thought it had been a
week at the earliest. Will I tell you what you might do? You are my great
blate bold son, you know, from the moors of Mearns, and I will be wae,
wae, to think of you travelling all round Europe without a friend of your
own country to exchange a word with. Write to me; will you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed and I will, and that gaily,&rdquo; I cried, delighted at the prospect.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you will tell me all your exploits and where you have been and what
you have seen, and where you are going and what you are going to do, and
be sure there will be one Scots heart thinking of you (besides Isobel, I
daresay), and I declare to you this one will follow every league upon the
map, saying 'the blate lad's there to-day,' 'the blate lad's to be here at
noon to-morrow.' Is it a bargain? Because you know I will write to you&mdash;but
oh! I forgot; what of the priest? Not for worlds would I have him know
that I kept up a correspondence with his secretary. That is bad.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She gazed rather expectantly at me as if looking for a suggestion, but the
problem was beyond me, and she sighed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course his reverence need not know anything about it,&rdquo; she said then.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I acquiesced, jumping at so obvious a solution. &ldquo;I will never
mention to him anything about it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But how will I get your letters and how will you get mine without his
suspecting something?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but he cannot suspect.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, and he a priest, too! It's his trade, Mr. Greig, and this Father
Hamilton would spoil all if he knew we were indulging ourselves so
innocently. What you must do is to send your letters to me in a way that I
shall think of before you leave and I shall answer in the same way. But
never a word, remember, to his reverence; I depend on your honour for
that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As I was going down the stair a little later, she leaned over the
bannister and cried after me:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Greig,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;ye needna' be sae hainin' wi' your red shoes when
ye're traivellin' in the coach. I would be greatly pleased to be thinkin'
of you as traivellin' in them a' the time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I looked up and saw her smiling saucily at me over the rail.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you indeed?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Then I'll never put them aff till I see ye
again, when I come back to Dunkerque.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is kind,&rdquo; she answered, laughing outright, &ldquo;but fair reediculous. To
wear them to bed would be against your character for sobriety.&rdquo;
 </p>

CHAPTER XIX
</h2>
<h3>
A RAP IN THE EARLY MORNING AWAKENS ME AND I START IN A GLASS COACH UPON
THE ODDEST OF JOURNEYS
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the last, for many months, I was to see of my countrywoman. Before
the crow of the cock next morning I was on the unending roads, trundling
in a noisy vehicle through pitch darkness, my companion snoring stertorous
at my side, his huge head falling every now and then upon my shoulder,
myself peering to catch some revelation of what manner of country-side we
went through as the light from the swinging lanthorn lit up briefly
passing banks of frosted hedge or sleeping hamlets on whose pave the hoofs
of our horses hammered as they had been the very war-steeds of Bellona.
</p>
<p>
But how came I there? How but by my master's whim, that made him
anticipate his departure by three days and drag me from my bed incontinent
to set out upon his trip over Europe.
</p>
<p>
I had been sleeping soundly, dreaming I heard the hopper of the mill of
Driepps at home banging to make Jock Alexander's fortune, when I awakened,
or rather half-wakened, to discover that 'twas no hopper but a nieve at my
door, rapping with a vigour to waken the dead.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come out! Sir Secretary, come out! or I shall pull thy domicile about
thine ears,&rdquo; cried the voice of Father Hamilton.
</p>
<p>
He stood at the door when I opened, wrapped over the chin in a muffler of
multitudinous folds, and covered by a roquelaure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Pax!</i>&rdquo; he cried, thrusting a purple face into the room, &ldquo;and on
with thy boots like a good lad. We must be off and over the dunes before
the bell of St. Eloi knocks another nail in the coffin of time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I said, dumbfoundered, &ldquo;are we to start on our journey to-day?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Even so, my sluggardly Scot; faith! before the day even, for the day will
be in a deuce of a hurry an' it catch up on us before we reach
Pont-Opoise. Sop a crust in a jug of wine&mdash;I've had no better <i>petit
déjeuner</i> myself&mdash;put a clean cravat and a pair of hose in thy
sack, and in all emulate the judicious flea that wastes no time in idle
rumination, but transacts its affairs in a succession of leaps.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And no time to say good-bye to anyone?&rdquo; I asked, struggling into my
toilet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;La! la! la! the flea never takes a <i>congé</i> that I've heard on,
Master Punctilio. Not so much as a kiss o' the hand for you; I have had
news, and 'tis now or never.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Twenty minutes later, Thurot's landlord (for Thurot himself was from home)
lit me to the courtyard, and the priest bundled me and my sack into the
bowels of an enormous chariot waiting there.
</p>
<p>
The clocks began to strike the hour of five; before the last stroke had
ceased to shiver the darkness we were thundering along the sea front and
my master was already composed to sleep in his corner, without vouchsafing
me a sentence of explanation for so hurried a departure. Be sure my heart
was sore! I felt the blackest of ingrates to be thus speeding without a
sign of farewell from a place where I had met with so much of friendship.
</p>
<p>
Out at the window of the coach I gazed, to see nothing but the cavernous
night on one side, on the other, lit by the lanthorn, the flashing past of
houses all shuttered and asleep.
</p>
<p>
It was dry and pleasant weather, with a sting of frost in the air, and the
propinquity of the sea manifest not in its plangent voice alone but in the
odour of it that at that hour dominated the natural smells of the
faubourgs. Only one glimpse I had of fellow creatures; as we passed the
fort, the flare of flambeaux showed an enormous body of soldiers working
upon the walls of Risebank; it but added to the poignance of my melancholy
to reflect that here were my country's enemies unsleeping, and I made a
sharp mental contrast of this most dauntening spectacle with a picture of
the house of Hazel Den dreaming among its trees, and only crying lambs
perhaps upon the moor to indicate that any life was there. Melancholy! oh,
it was eerie beyond expression for me that morning! Outside, the driver
talked to his horses and to some one with him on the boot; it must have
been cheerier for him than for me as I sat in that sombre and close
interior, jolted by my neighbour, and unable to refrain from
rehabilitating all the past. Especially did I think of my dark home-coming
with a silent father on the day I left the college to go back to the
Mearns. And by a natural correlation, that was bound to lead to all that
followed&mdash;even to the event for which I was now so miserably remote
from my people.
</p>
<p>
Once or twice his reverence woke, to thrust his head out at the window and
ask where we were. Wherever we were when he did so, *twas certain never to
be far enough for his fancy, and he condemned the driver for a snail until
the whip cracked wickedly and the horses laboured more strenuously than
ever, so that our vehicle swung upon its springs till it might well seem
we were upon a ship at sea.
</p>
<p>
For me he had but the one comment&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder what's for <i>déjeuner.</i>&rdquo;
 He said it each time solemnly as it were his matins, and then slid into
his swinish sleep again.
</p>
<p>
The night seemed interminable, but by-and-by the day broke. I watched it
with eagerness as it gradually paled the east, and broke up the black bulk
of the surrounding land into fields, orchards, gardens, woods. And the
birds awoke&mdash;God bless the little birds!&mdash;they woke, and started
twittering and singing in the haze, surely the sweetest, the least sinless
of created things, the tiny angels of the woods, from whom, walking in
summer fields in the mornings of my age as of my youth, I have borrowed
hope and cheer.
</p>
<p>
Father Hamilton wakened too, and heard the birds; indeed, they filled the
ear of the dawn with melodies. A smile singularly pleasant came upon his
countenance as he listened.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i>&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how they go on! Has't the woodland soul, <i>Sieur
Croque-mort</i>? Likely enough not; I never knew another but myself and
thine uncle that had it, and 'tis the mischief that words will not explain
the same. 'Tis a gift of the fairies&rdquo;&mdash;here he crossed himself
devoutly and mumbled a Romish incantation&mdash;&ldquo;that, having the said
woodland spirit&mdash;in its nature a Pagan thing perchance, but <i>n'importe!</i>&mdash;thou
hast in the song of the tiny beings choiring there something to make the
inward tremor that others find in a fiddle and a glass of wine. No! no!
not that, 'tis a million times more precious; 'tis&mdash;'tis the pang of
the devotee, 'tis the ultimate thrill of things. Myself, I could expire
upon the ecstasy of the thrush, or climb to heaven upon the lark's May
rapture. And there they go! the loves! and they have the same ditty I
heard from them first in Louvain. There are but three clean things in this
world, my lad of Scotland&mdash;a bird, a flower, and a child's laughter.
I have been confessor long enough to know all else is filth. But what's
the luck in waiting for us at Azincourt? and what's the <i>pot-au-feu</i>
to-day?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He listened a little longer to the birds, and fell asleep smiling, his fat
face for once not amiss, and I was left again alone as it were to receive
the day.
</p>
<p>
We had long left the dunes and the side of the sea, though sometimes on
puffs of wind I heard its distant rumour. Now the land was wooded with the
apple tree; we rose high on the side of a glen, full of a rolling fog that
streamed off as the day grew. A tolerable land enough; perhaps more lush
than my own, with scarce a rood uncultivated, and dotted far and wide by
the strangest farm steadings and pendicles, but such steadings and
pendicles as these eyes never before beheld, with enormous eaves of thatch
reaching almost to the ground, and ridiculous windows of no shape; with
the yokings of the cattle, the boynes, stoups, carts, and ploughs about
the places altogether different from our own. We passed troops marching,
peasants slouching with baskets of poultry to market towns, now and then a
horseman, now and then a caleche. And there were numerous hamlets, and at
least two middling-sized towns, and finally we came, at the hour of
eleven, upon the place appointed for our <i>déjeuner</i>. It was a small
inn on the banks of the only rivulet I had seen in all the journey. I
forget its name, but I remember there was a patch of heather on the side
of it, and that I wished ardently the season had been autumn that I might
have looked upon the purple bells.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tis a long lane that has no tavern,&rdquo; said his reverence, and oozed out of
his side of the coach with groanings. The innkeeper ran forth, louted, and
kissed his hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Jour, m'sieu jour!</i>&rdquo; said Father Hamilton hurriedly. &ldquo;And now, what
have you here that is worth while?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The innkeeper respectfully intimated that the church of
Saint-Jean-en-Grève was generally considered worth notice. Its vestments,
relics, and windows were of merit, and the view from the tower&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mort de ma vie!</i>&rdquo; cried the priest angrily, &ldquo;do I look like a
traveller who trots up belfrys in strange villages at the hour of <i>déjeuner?</i>
A plague on Saint-Jean-en-Grève! I said nothing at all of churches; I
spoke of <i>déjeuner</i>, my good fellow. What's for <i>déjeuner?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The innkeeper recounted a series of dishes. Father Hamilton hummed and
hawed, reflected, condemned, approved, all with an eagerness beyond
description. And when the meal was being dished up, he went frantically to
the kitchen and lifted pot-lids, and swung a salad for himself, and
confounding the ordinary wine for the vilest piquette ordered a special
variety from the cellar. It was a spectacle of gourmandise not without its
humour; I was so vastly engaged in watching him that I scarce glanced at
the men who had travelled on the outside of the coach since morning.
</p>
<p>
What was my amazement when I did so to see that the servant or valet (as
he turned out to be) was no other than the Swiss, Bernard, who had been in
the service of Miss Walkinshaw no later than yesterday morning!
</p>
<p>
I commented on the fact to Father Hamilton when we sat down to eat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo; he said, gobbling at his vivers with a voracity I learned not
to wonder at later when I knew him more. &ldquo;The same man. A good man, too,
or I'm a Turk. I've envied Miss Walkinshaw this lusty, trusty, secret
rogue for a good twelvemonth, and just on the eve of my leaving Dunkerque,
by a very providence, the fellow gets drunk and finds himself dismissed.
He came to me with a flush and a hiccough last night to ask a
recommendation, and overlooking the peccadillo that is not of a nature
confined to servants, Master Greig, let me tell thee, I gave him a place
in my <i>entourage</i>. Madame will not like it, but no matter! she'll
have time to forget it ere I see her again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I felt a mild satisfaction to have the Swiss with us just because I had
heard him called &ldquo;Bernard&rdquo; so often by his late employer.
</p>
<p>
We rested for some hours after <i>déjeuner</i>, seated under a tree by the
brink of the rivulet, and in the good humour of a man satisfied in nature
the priest condescended to let me into some of his plans.
</p>
<p>
We were bound for Paris in the first place. &ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I am all
impatience to clap eyes again on Lutetia, the sweet rogue, and eat decent
bread and behold a noble gown and hear a right cadenza. And though thou
hast lost thy Lyrnessides&mdash;la! la! la! I have thee there!&mdash;thou
canst console thyself with the Haemonian lyre. Paris! oh, lad, I'd give
all to have thy years and a winter or two in it. Still, we shall make
shift&mdash;oh, yes! I warrant thee we shall make shift. We shall be
there, at my closest reckoning, on the second day of Holy Week, and my
health being so poorly we shall not wait to commence <i>de faire les
Pâques</i> an hour after. What's in a <i>soutane</i>, anyhow, that it
should be permitted to mortify an honest priest's oesophagus?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I sighed in spite of myself, for he had made me think of our throwing of
Easter eggs on the green at Hazel Den.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Does my frugal Scot fancy we have not enough trinkgeld
for enjoyment. Why, look here!&mdash;and here!&mdash;and here!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He thrust his hand into his bosom and drew forth numerous rouleaux&mdash;so
many that I thought his corpulence might well be a plethora of coin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said he, squeezing a rouleau till it burst and spreading out the
gold upon the table before him. &ldquo;Am I a poor parish priest or a very
Croesus?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then he scooped in the coins with his fat hands and returned all to his
bosom. &ldquo;<i>Allons!</i>&rdquo; he said shortly; we were on the road again!
</p>
<p>
That night we put up at the Bon Accueil in a town whose name escapes my
recollection.
</p>
<p>
He had gone to bed; through the wall from his chamber came the noise of
his sleep, while I was at the writing of my first letter to Miss
Walkinshaw, making the same as free and almost affectionate as I had been
her lover, for as I know it now, I was but seeking in her for the face of
the love of the first woman and the last my heart was given to.
</p>
<p>
I had scarcely concluded when the Swiss came knocking softly to my door,
and handed me a letter from the very woman whose name was still in wet ink
upon my folded page. I tore it open eagerly, to find a score of pleasant
remembrances. She had learned the night before that the priest was to set
out in the morning: &ldquo;I have kept my word,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Your best friend
is Bernard, so I let you have him, and let us exchange our billets through
him. It will be the most Discreet method. And I am, with every
consideration, Ye Ken Wha.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XX
</h2>
<h3>
LEADS ME TO THE FRONT OF A COFFEE-HOUSE WHERE I AM STARTLED TO SEE A FACE
I KNOW
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he occasion for this precaution in our correspondence was beyond my
comprehension; nevertheless I was too proud to have the patronage of so
fine a woman to cavil at what system she should devise for its discreet
conduct, and the Swiss that night got my first letter to frank and
despatch. He got one next evening also, and the evening after that; in
short, I made a diurnal of each stage in our journey and Bernard was my
postman&mdash;so to name it&mdash;on every occasion that I forwarded the
same to Miss Walkinshaw. He assured me that he was in circumstances to
secure the more prompt forwardation of my epistles than if I trusted in
the common runner, and it was a proof of this that when we got, after some
days, into Versailles, he should bring to me a letter from the lady
herself informing me how much of pleasure she had got from the receipt of
the first communication I had sent her.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it is a sign of the injudicious mind that I should not be very
mightily pleased with this same Versailles. We had come into it of a sunny
afternoon and quartered at the Cerf d'Or Inn, and went out in the evening
for the air. Somehow the place gave me an antagonism; its dipt trees all
in rows upon the wayside like a guard of soldiers; its trim gardens and
bits of plots; its fountains crying, as it seemed, for attention&mdash;these
things hurt me as a liberty taken with nature. Here, thought I, is the
fitting place for the raff in ruffles and the scented wanton; it should be
the artificial man and the insincere woman should be condemned to walk for
ever in these alleys and drink in these <i>bosquets;</i> I would not give
a fir planting black against the evening sky at home for all this pompous
play-acting at landscape, nor a yard of the brown heather of the hills for
all these well-drilled flower parterres.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh! M. Croque-mort,&rdquo; said the priest, delighted visibly with all he saw
about him; &ldquo;what think'st thou of Le Notre's gardening?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A good deal, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that need never be mentioned. I feel a pity
for the poor trees as I did for yon dipt poodle dog at Griepon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;La! la! la! <i>sots raissonable</i>, Monsieur,&rdquo; cried the priest. &ldquo;We
cannot have the tastes of our Dubarrys and Pompadours and Maintenons so
called in question by an untravelled Scot that knows but the rude mountain
and stunted oaks dying in a murrain of climate. 'Art too ingenuous, youth.
And yet&mdash;and yet&rdquo;&mdash;here he paused and tapped his temple and
smiled whimsically&mdash;&ldquo;between ourselves, I prefer the woods of Somme
where the birds sang together so jocund t'other day. But there now&mdash;ah,
<i>quelle gloire!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We had come upon the front of the palace, and its huge far-reaching
masonry, that I learned later to regard as cold, formal, and wanting in a
soul, vastly discomposed me. I do not know why it should be so, but as I
gazed at this&mdash;the greatest palace I had ever beheld&mdash;I felt
tears rush irrestrainably to my eyes. Maybe it was the poor little poet in
MacGibbon's law chamber in Lanark town that used to tenant every ancient
dwelling with spirits of the past, cropped up for the moment in Father
Hamilton's secretary, and made me, in a flash, people the place with kings&mdash;and
realise something of the wrench it must have been and still would be to
each and all of them to say adieu at the long last to this place of noisy
grandeur where they had had their time of gaiety and splendour. Anyhow, I
well-nigh wept, and the priest was quick to see it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fore God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;here's Andrew Greig again! 'Twas the wickedest
rogue ever threw dice, and yet the man must rain at the eyes like a very
woman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And yet he was pleased, I thought, to see me touched. A band was playing
somewhere in a garden unseen; he tapped time to its music with his finger
tips against each other and smiled beatifically and hummed. He seemed at
peace with the world and himself at that moment, yet a second later he was
the picture of distress and apprehension.
</p>
<p>
We were going towards the Place d'Armes; he had, as was customary, his arm
through mine, leaning on me more than was comfortable, for he was the
poorest judge imaginable of his own corpulence. Of a sudden I felt him
jolt as if he had been startled, and then he gripped my arm with a nervous
grasp. All that was to account for his perturbation was that among the few
pedestrians passing us on the road was one in a uniform who cast a rapid
glance at us. It was not wonderful that he should do so, for indeed we
were a singularly ill-assorted pair, but there was a recognition of the
priest in the glance the man in the uniform threw at him in passing.
Nothing was said; the man went on his way and we on ours, but looking at
Father Hamilton I saw his face had lost its colour and grown blotched in
patches. His hand trembled; for the rest of the walk he was silent, and he
could not too soon hurry us back to the Cerf d'Or.
</p>
<p>
Next day was Sunday, and Father Hamilton went to Mass leaving me to my own
affairs, that were not of that complexion perhaps most becoming on that
day to a lad from Scotland. He came back anon and dressed most
scrupulously in a suit of lay clothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come out, Master Greig,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and use thine eyes for a poor priest
that has ruined his own in studying the Fathers and seeking for honesty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is not in the nature of a compliment to myself, that,&rdquo; I said, a
little tired of his sour sentiments regarding humanity, and not afraid in
the least to tell him so.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I spoke not of thee, thou savage. A plague on thy curt
temper; 'twas ever the weakness of the Greigs. Come, and I shall show thee
a house where thy uncle and I had many a game of dominoes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We went to a coffee-house and watched the fashionable world go by. It was
a sight monstrously fine. Because it was the Easter Sunday the women had
on their gayest apparel, the men their most belaced <i>jabots</i>.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now look you well, Friend Scotland,&rdquo; said Father Hamilton, as we sat at a
little table and watched the stream of quality pass, &ldquo;look you well and
watch particularly every gentleman that passes to the right, and when you
see one you know tell me quickly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He had dropped his Roman manner as if in too sober a mood to act.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it a game?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Who can I ken in the town of Versailles that
never saw me here before?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do as I tell you. A sharp eye, and-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;there's a man I have seen before!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where? where?&rdquo; said Father Hamilton, with the utmost interest lighting
his countenance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yonder, to the left of the man with the velvet breeches. He will pass us
in a minute or two.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The person I meant would have been kenspeckle in any company by the
splendour of his clothing, but beyond his clothing there was a haughtiness
in his carriage that singled him out even among the fashionables of
Versailles, who were themselves obviously interested in his personality,
to judge by the looks that they gave him as closely as breeding permitted.
He came sauntering along the pavement swinging a cane by its tassel, his
chin in the air, his eyes anywhere but on the crowds that parted to give
him room. As he came closer I saw it was a handsome face enough that thus
was cocked in haughtiness to the heavens, not unlike Clancarty's in that
it showed the same signs of dissipation, yet with more of native nobility
in it than was in the good enough countenance of the French-Irish
nobleman. Where had I seen that face before?
</p>
<p>
It must have been in Scotland; it must have been when I was a boy; it was
never in the Mearns. This was a hat with a Dettingen cock; when I saw that
forehead last it was under a Highland bonnet.
</p>
<p>
A Highland bonnet&mdash;why! yes, and five thousand Highland bonnets were
in its company&mdash;whom had I here but Prince Charles Edward!
</p>
<p>
The recognition set my heart dirling in my breast, for there was enough of
the rebel in me to feel a romantic glow at seeing him who set Scotland in
a blaze, and was now the stuff of songs our women sang in milking folds
among the hills; that heads had fallen for, and the Hebrides had been
searched for in vain for weary seasons. The man was never a hero of mine
so long as I had the cooling influence of my father to tell me how
lamentable for Scotland had been his success had God permitted the same,
yet I was proud to-day to see him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it he?&rdquo; asked the priest, dividing his attention between me and the
approaching nobleman.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's no other,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I would know Prince Charles in ten thousand,
though I saw him but the once in a rabble of caterans coming up the
Gallow-gate of Glasgow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the priest, with a curious sighing sound. &ldquo;They said he passed
here at the hour. And that's our gentleman, is it? I expected he would
have been&mdash;would have been different.&rdquo; When the Prince was opposite
the café where we sat he let his glance come to earth, and it fell upon
myself. His aspect changed; there was something of recognition in it;
though he never slackened his pace and was gazing the next moment down the
vista of the street, I knew that his glance had taken me in from head to
heel, and that I was still the object of his thoughts.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You see! you see!&rdquo; cried the priest, &ldquo;I was right, and he knew the Greig.
Why, lad, shalt have an Easter egg for this&mdash;the best horologe in
Versailles upon Monday morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, how could he know me?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;It is an impossibility, for when he
and I were in the same street last he rode a horse high above an army and
I was only a raw laddie standing at a close-mouth in Duff's Land in the
Gallowgate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But all the same I felt the priest was right, and that there was some sort
of recognition in the Prince's glance at me in passing.
</p>
<p>
Father Hamilton poured himself a generous glass and drank thirstily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;La! la! la!&rdquo; said he, resuming his customary manner of address. &ldquo;I
daresay his Royal Highness has never clapt eyes on thy <i>croque-mori</i>
countenance before, but he has seen its like&mdash;ay, and had a regard
for it, too! Thine Uncle Andrew has done the thing for thee again; the
mole, the hair, the face, the shoes&mdash;sure they advertise the Greig as
by a drum tuck! and Charles Edward knew thy uncle pretty well so I
supposed he would know thee. And this is my gentleman, is it? Well, well!
No, not at all well; mighty ill indeed. Not the sort of fellow I had
looked for at all. Seems a harmless man enough, and has tossed many a
goblet in the way of company. If he had been a sour whey-face now&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Father Hamilton applied himself most industriously to the bottle that
afternoon, and it was not long till the last of my respect for him was
gone. Something troubled him. He was moody and hilarious by turns, but
neither very long, and completed my distrust of him when he intimated that
there was some possibility of our trip across Europe never coming into
effect. But all the same, I was to be assured of his patronage, I was to
continue in his service as secretary, if, as was possible, he should take
up his residence for a time in Paris. And money&mdash;why, look again! he
had a ship's load of it, and 'twould never be said of Father Hamilton that
he could not share with a friend. And there he thrust some rouleaux upon
me and clapped my shoulder and was so affected at his own love for Andrew
Greig's nephew that he must even weep.
</p>
<p>
Weeping indeed was the priest's odd foible for the week we remained at
Versailles. He that had been so jocular before was now filled with morose
moods, and would ruminate over his bottle by the hour at a time.
</p>
<p>
He was none the better for the company he met during our stay at the Cerf
d'Or&mdash;all priests, and to the number of half a dozen, one of them an
abbé with a most noble and reverent countenance. They used to come to him
late at night, confer with him secretly in his room, and when they were
gone I found him each time drenched in a perspiration and feverishly
gulping spirits.
</p>
<p>
Every day we went to the café where we had seen the Prince first, and
every day at the same hour we saw his Royal Highness, who, it appeared,
was not known to the world as such, though known to me. The sight of him
seemed to trouble Father Hamilton amazingly, and yet 'twas the grand
object of the day&mdash;its only diversion; when we had seen the Prince we
went back straight to the inn every afternoon.
</p>
<p>
The Cerf d'Or had a courtyard, cobbled with rough stones, in which there
was a great and noisy traffic. In the midst of the court there was a
little clump of evergreen trees and bushes in tubs, round which were
gathered a few tables and chairs whereat&mdash;now that the weather was
mild&mdash;the world sat in the afternoon. The walls about were covered
with dusty ivy where sparrows had begun to busy themselves with love and
housekeeping; lilacs sprouted into green, and the porter of the house was
for ever scratching at the hard earth about the plants, and tying up twigs
and watering the pots. It was here I used to write my letters to Miss
Walkinshaw at a little table separate from the rest, and I think it was on
Friday I was at this pleasant occupation when I looked up to see the man
with the uniform gazing at me from the other side of the bushes as if he
were waiting to have the letter when I was done with it.
</p>
<p>
I went in and asked Father Hamilton who this man was.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried in a great disturbance, &ldquo;the same as we met near the
Trianon! O Lord! Paul, there is something wrong, for that was Buhot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this Buhot?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A police inspector. There is no time to lose. Monsieur Greig, I want you
to do an office for me. Here is a letter that must find its way into the
hands of the Prince. You will give it to him. You have seen that he passes
the café at the same hour every day. Well, it is the easiest thing in the
world for you to go up to him and hand him this. No more's to be done by
you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But why should I particularly give him the letter? Why not send it by the
Swiss?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is my affair,&rdquo; cried the priest testily. &ldquo;The Prince knows you&mdash;that
is important. He knows the Swiss too, and that is why I have the Swiss
with me as a second string to my bow, but I prefer that he should have
this letter from the hand of M. Andrew Greig's nephew. 'Tis a letter from
his Royal Highness's most intimate friend.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I took the letter into my hand, and was amazed to see that the address was
in a writing exactly corresponding to that of a billet now in the bosom of
my coat!
</p>
<p>
What could Miss Walkinshaw and the Prince have of correspondence to be
conducted on such roundabout lines? Still, if the letter was hers I must
carry it!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I agreed, and went out to meet the Prince.
</p>
<p>
The sun was blazing; the street was full of the quality in their summer
clothing. His Royal Highness came stepping along at the customary hour
more gay than ever. I made bold to call myself to his attention with my
hat in my hand. &ldquo;I beg your Royal Highness's pardon,&rdquo; I said in English,
&ldquo;but I have been instructed to convey this letter to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He swept his glance over me; pausing longest of all on my red shoes, and
took the letter from my hand. He gave a glance at the direction, reddened,
and bit his lip.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me see now, what is the name of the gentleman who does me the
honour?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Greig,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Paul Greig.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;of course: I have had friends in Monsieur's family. <i>Charmé,
Monsieur, de faire votre connaissance</i>. M. Andrew Greig-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was my uncle, your Royal Highness?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So! a dear fellow, but, if I remember rightly, with a fatal gift of
irony. 'Tis a quality to be used with tact. I hope you have tact, M.
Greig. Your good uncle once did me the honour to call me a&mdash;what was
it now?&mdash;a gomeral.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was very like my uncle, that, your Royal Highness,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I
know that he loved you and your cause.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I daresay he did, Monsieur; I daresay he did,&rdquo; said the Prince, flushing,
and with a show of pleasure at my speech. &ldquo;I have learned of late that the
fair tongue is not always the friendliest. In spite of it all I liked M.
Andrew Greig. I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing Monsieur Greig's
nephew soon again. <i>Au plaisir de vous revoir!</i>&rdquo; And off he went,
putting the letter, unread, into his pocket.
</p>
<p>
When I went back to the Cerf d'Or and told Hamilton all that had passed,
he was straightway plunged into the most unaccountable melancholy.

CHAPTER XXI
</h2>
<h3>
THE ATTEMPT ON THE PRINCE
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd now I come to an affair of which there have been many accounts
written, some of them within a mile or two of the truth, the most but
sheer romantics. I have in my mind notably the account of the officer
Buhot printed two years after the events in question, in which he makes
the most fabulous statement as to the valiancy of Father Hamilton's stand
in the private house in the Rue des Reservoirs, and maintains that myself&mdash;<i>le
fier Eccossais</i>, as he is flattering enough to designate me&mdash;drew
my sword upon himself and threatened to run him through for his
proposition that I should confess to a complicity in the attempt upon his
Royal Highness. I have seen his statement reproduced with some extra
ornament in the <i>Edinburgh Courant</i>, and the result of all this is
that till this day my neighbours give me credit, of which I am loth to
advantage myself, for having felled two or three of the French officers
before I was overcome at the hinder-end.
</p>
<p>
The matter is, in truth, more prosaic as it happened, and if these
memorials of mine leave the shadow of a doubt in the minds of any
interested in an old story that created some stir in its time, I pray them
see the archives of M. Bertin, the late Lieut.-General of the police.
Bertin was no particular friend of mine, that had been the unconscious
cause of great trouble and annoyance to him, but he has the truth in the
deposition I made and signed prior to my appointment to a company of the
d'Auvergne regiment.
</p>
<p>
Well, to take matters in their right order, it was the evening of the day
I had given the letter to the Prince that Father Hamilton expressed his
intention of passing that night in the house of a friend.
</p>
<p>
I looked at him with manifest surprise, for he had been at the bottle most
of the afternoon, and was by now more in a state for his bed than for
going among friends.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he cried peevishly, observing my dubiety. &ldquo;Do you think me too
drunk for the society of a parcel of priests? <i>Ma foi!</i> it is a
pretty thing that I cannot budge from my ordinary habitude of things
without a stuck owl setting up a silent protest.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
To a speech so wanting in dignity I felt it better there should be no
reply, and instead I helped him into his great-coat. As I did so, he made
an awkward lurching movement due to his corpulence, and what jumped out of
an inner pocket but a pistol? Which of us was the more confused at that it
would be hard to say. For my part, the weapon&mdash;that I had never seen
in his possession before&mdash;was a fillip to my sleeping conscience; I
picked it up with a distaste, and he took it from me with trembling
fingers and an averted look.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A dangerous place, Versailles, after dark,&rdquo; he explained feebly. &ldquo;One
never knows, one never knows,&rdquo; and into his pocket hurriedly with it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I shall be back for breakfast,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Unless&mdash;unless&mdash;oh,
I certainly shall be back.&rdquo; And off he set.
</p>
<p>
The incident of the pistol disturbed me for a while. I made a score of
speculations as to why a fat priest should burden himself with such an
article, and finally concluded that it was as he suggested, to defend
himself from night birds if danger offered; though that at the time had
been the last thing I myself would have looked for in the well-ordered
town of Versailles. I sat in the common-room or <i>salle</i> of the inn
for a while after he had gone, and thereafter retired to my own
bedchamber, meaning to read or write for an hour or two before going to
bed. In the priest's room&mdash;which was on the same landing and next to
my own&mdash;I heard the whistle of Bernard the Swiss, but I had no
letters for him that evening, and we did not meet each other. I was at
first uncommon dull, feeling more than usually the hame-wae that must have
been greatly wanting in the experience of my Uncle Andrew to make him for
so long a wanderer on the face of the earth. But there is no condition of
life so miserable but what one finds in it remissions, diversions, nay,
and delights also, and soon I was&mdash;of all things in the world to be
doing when what followed came to pass!&mdash;inditing a song to a lady, my
quill scratching across the paper in spurts and dashes, and baffled pauses
where the matter would not attend close enough on the mood, stopping
altogether at a stanza's end to hum the stuff over to myself with great
satisfaction. I was, as I say, in the midst of this; the Swiss had gone
downstairs; all in my part of the house was still, though vehicles moved
about in the courtyard, when unusually noisy footsteps sounded on the
stair, with what seemed like the tap of scabbards on the treads.
</p>
<p>
It was a sound so strange that my hand flew by instinct to the small sword
I was now in the habit of wearing and had learned some of the use of from
Thurot.
</p>
<p>
There was no knock for entrance; the door was boldly opened and four
officers with Buhot at their head were immediately in the room.
</p>
<p>
Buhot intimated in French that I was to consider myself under arrest, and
repeated the same in indifferent English that there might be no mistake
about a fact as patent as that the sword was in his hand.
</p>
<p>
For a moment I thought the consequence of my crime had followed me abroad,
and that this squat, dark officer, watching me with the scrutiny of a
forest animal, partly in a dread that my superior bulk should endanger
himself, was in league with the law of my own country. That I should after
all be dragged back in chains to a Scots gallows was a prospect
unendurable; I put up the ridiculous small sword and dared him to lay a
hand on me. But I had no sooner done so than its folly was apparent, and I
laid the weapon down.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Tant mieux!</i>&rdquo; said he, much relieved, and then an assurance that he
knew I was a gentleman of discretion and would not make unnecessary
trouble. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;<i>Voyez!</i> I take these men away; I
have the infinite trust in Monsieur; Monsieur and I shall settle this
little affair between us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And he sent his friends to the foot of the stair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur may compose himself,&rdquo; he assured me with a profound inclination.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; I said, seating myself on the corner of
the table and crushing my poor verses into my pocket as I did so, &ldquo;I am
very much obliged to you, but I'm at a loss to understand to what I owe
the honour.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he said, also seating himself on the table to show, I supposed,
that he was on terms of confidence with his prisoner. &ldquo;Monsieur is Father
Hamilton's secretary?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I believe,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;at least I engaged for the office that's
something of a sinecure, to tell the truth.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And then Buhot told me a strange story.
</p>
<p>
He told me that Father Hamilton was now a prisoner, and on his way to the
prison of Bicêtre. He was&mdash;this Buhot&mdash;something of the artist
and loved to make his effects most telling (which accounts, no doubt, for
the romantical nature of the accounts aforesaid), and sitting upon the
table-edge he embarked upon a narrative of the most crowded two hours that
had perhaps been in Father Hamilton's lifetime.
</p>
<p>
It seemed that when the priest had left the Cerf d'Or, he had gone to a
place till recently called the Bureau des Carrosses pour la Rochelle, and
now unoccupied save by a concierge, and the property of some person or
persons unknown. There he had ensconced himself in the only habitable room
and waited for a visitor regarding whom the concierge had his
instructions.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must imagine him,&rdquo; said the officer, always with the fastidiousness
of an artist for his effects, &ldquo;you must imagine him, Monsieur, sitting in
this room, all alone, breathing hard, with a pistol before him on the
table, and&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! a pistol!&rdquo; I cried, astounded and alarmed. &ldquo;<i>Certainement</i>&rdquo;
 said Buhot, charmed with the effect his dramatic narrative was creating.
&ldquo;Your friend, <i>mon ami</i>, would be little good, I fancy, with a
rapier. Anyway, 'twas a pistol. A carriage drives up to the door; the
priest rises to his feet with the pistol in his hand; there is the rap at
the door. '<i>Entrez!</i>' cries the priest, cocking the pistol, and no
sooner was his visitor within than he pulled the trigger; the explosion
rang through the dwelling; the chamber was full of smoke.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I cried in horror, &ldquo;and who was the unhappy wretch?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Buhot shrugged his shoulders, made a French gesture with his hands, and
pursed his mouth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whom did you invite to the room at the hour of ten, M. Greig?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Invite!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;It's your humour to deal in parables. I declare to you
I invited no one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet, my good sir, you are Hamilton's secretary and you are Hamilton's
envoy. 'Twas you handed to the Prince the <i>poulet</i> that was designed
to bring him to his fate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
My instinct grasped the situation in a second; I had been the ignorant
tool of a madman; the whole events of the past week made the fact plain,
and I was for the moment stunned.
</p>
<p>
Buhot watched me closely, and not unkindly, I can well believe, from what
I can recall of our interview and all that followed after it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you tell me he killed the Prince?&rdquo; I cried at last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, Monsieur,&rdquo; said Buhot; &ldquo;I am happy to say he did not. The Prince was
better advised than to accept the invitation you sent to him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; I cried with remorse, &ldquo;there's a man dead, and 'tis as much as
happens when princes themselves are clay.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Parfaitement</i>, Monsieur, though it is indiscreet to shout it here.
Luckily there is no one at all dead in this case, otherwise it had been
myself, for I was the man who entered to the priest and received his
pistol fire. It was not the merriest of duties either,&rdquo; he went on, always
determined I should lose no iota of the drama, &ldquo;for the priest might have
discovered before I got there that the balls of his pistol had been
abstracted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then Father Hamilton has been under watch?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Since ever you set foot in Versailles last Friday,&rdquo; said Buhot
complacently. &ldquo;The Damiens affair has sharpened our wits, I warrant you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let me protest that I have been till this moment in
utter darkness about Hamilton's character or plans. I took him for what he
seemed&mdash;a genial buffoon of a kind with more gear than guidance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We cannot, with infinite regret, assume that, Monsieur, but personally I
would venture a suggestion,&rdquo; said Buhot, coming closer on the table and
assuming an affable air. &ldquo;In this business, Hamilton is a tool&mdash;no
more; and a poor one at that, badly wanting the grindstone. To break him&mdash;phew!&mdash;'twere
as easy as to break a glass, but he is one of a great movement and the man
we seek is his master&mdash;one Father Fleuriau of the Jesuits. Hamilton's
travels were but part of a great scheme that has sent half a dozen of his
kind chasing the Prince in the past year or two from Paris to Amsterdam,
from Amsterdam to Orleans, from Orleans to Hamburg, Seville, Lisbon, Rome,
Brussels, Potsdam, Nuremburg, Berlin. The same hand that extracted his
bullets tapped the priest's portfolio and found the wretch was in promise
of a bishopric and a great sum of money. You see, M. Greig, I am curiously
frank with my prisoner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And no doubt you have your reasons,&rdquo; said I, but beat, myself, to imagine
what they could be save that he might have proofs of my innocence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said M. Buhot. &ldquo;To come to the point, it is this, that we
desire to have the scheme of the Jesuits for the Prince's assassination,
and other atrocities shocking to all that revere the divinity of princes,
crumbled up. Father Hamilton is at the very roots of the secret; if, say,
a gentleman so much in his confidence as yourself&mdash;now, if such a one
were, say, to share a cell with this regicide for a night or two, and
pursue judicious inquiries&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; I cried, my blood hammering in my head, and the words like
to choke me. &ldquo;Am I to understand that you would make me your spy and
informer upon this miserable old madman that has led me such a gowk's
errand?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Buhot slid back off the table edge and on to his feet. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the
terms are not happily chosen: 'spy'&mdash;'informer'&mdash;come, Monsieur
Greig; this man is in all but the actual accomplishment of his purpose an
assassin. 'Tis the duty of every honest man to help in discovering the
band of murderers whose tool he has been.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I'm no honest man, M. Buhot,&rdquo; said I bitterly, &ldquo;for I've no stomach
for a duty so dirty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Think of it for a moment,&rdquo; he pressed, with evident surprise at my
decision. &ldquo;Bicêtre is an unwholesome hostelry, I give you my word.
Consider that your choice is between a night or two there and&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;a lifetime of Galbanon that is infinitely worse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then let it be Galbanon!&rdquo; I said, and lifted my sword and slapped it
furiously, sheathed as it was, like a switch upon the table.

<p>
Buhot leaped back in a fear that I was to attack him, and cried his men
from the stair foot.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This force is not needed at all,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am innocent enough to be
prepared to go quietly.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXII
</h2>
<h3>
OF A NIGHT JOURNEY AND BLACK BICETRE AT THE END OF IT
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>was a long journey to the prison of Bicêtre, which is two miles to the
south of the city of Paris, a great building that had once (they say) been
a palace, but now in the time of my experience was little better than a
vestibule of hell. I was driven to it through a black loud night of rain,
a plunging troop of horse on either hand the coach as if I were a
traveller of state, and Buhot in front of me as silent as the priest had
been the day we left Dunkerque, though wakeful, and the tip of his
scabbard leaning on my boot to make sure that in the darkness no movement
of mine should go unobserved.
</p>
<p>
The trees swung and roared in the wind; the glass lozens of the carriage
pattered to the pelting showers; sometimes we lurched horribly in the ruts
of the highway, and were released but after monstrous efforts on the part
of the cavaliers. Once, as we came close upon a loop of a brawling river,
I wished with all fervency that we might fall in, and so end for ever this
pitiful coil of trials whereto fate had obviously condemned poor Paul
Greig. To die among strangers (as is widely known) is counted the saddest
of deaths by our country people, and so, nowadays, it would seem to
myself, but there and then it appeared an enviable conclusion to the
Spoiled Horn that had blundered from folly to folly. To die there and then
would be to leave no more than a regret and an everlasting wonder in the
folks at home; to die otherwise, as seemed my weird, upon a block or
gallows, would be to foul the name of my family for generations, and I
realised in my own person the agony of my father when he got the news, and
I bowed my shoulders in the coach below the shame that he would feel as in
solemn blacks he walked through the Sabbath kirkyard in summers to come in
Mearns, with the knowledge that though neighbours looked not at him but
with kindness, their inmost thoughts were on the crimson chapter of his
son.
</p>
<p>
Well, we came at the long last to Bicêtre, and I was bade alight in the
flare of torches. A strange, a memorable scene; it will never leave me.
Often I remit me there in dreams. When I came out of the conveyance the
lights dazzled me, and Buhot put his hands upon my shoulders and turned me
without a word in the direction he wished me to take. It was through a
vast and frowning doorway that led into a courtyard so great that the
windows on the other side seemed to be the distance of a field. The
windows were innumerable, and though the hour was late they were lit in
stretching corridors. Fires flamed in corners of the yard&mdash;great
leaping fires round which warders (as I guessed them) gathered to dry
themselves or get warmth against the chill of the early April morning.
Their scabbards or their muskets glittered now and then in the light of
the flames; their voices&mdash;restrained by the presence of Buhot&mdash;sounded
deep and dreadful to me that knew not the sum of his iniquity yet could
shudder at the sense of what portended.
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/203.jpg" alt="203" width="100%" /><br />
</div>
<p>
It were vain for me to try and give expression to my feeling as I went
past these fires across the stony yard, and entered between a guard or two
at the other side. At the root of my horror was the sentiment that all was
foreign, that I was no more to these midnight monsters round their
torturing flames than a creature of the wood, less, perhaps, for were they
not at sworn war with my countrymen, and had not I a share at least of the
repute of regicide? And when, still led by the silent officer, I entered
the building itself and walked through an unending corridor broken at
intervals by black doors and little barred borrowed lights, and heard
sometimes a moan within, or a shriek far off in another part of the
building, I experienced something of that long swound that is insanity.
Then I was doomed for the rest of my brief days to be among these unhappy
wretches&mdash;the victims of the law or political vengeance, the <i>forçat</i>
who had thieved, or poisoned, perjured himself, or taken human blood!
</p>
<p>
At last we came to a door, where Buhot stopped me and spoke, for the first
time, almost, since we had left Versailles. He put his hand out to check a
warder who was going to open the cell for my entrance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not a hard man, M. Greig,&rdquo; said he, in a stumbling English, &ldquo;and
though this is far beyond my duties, and, indeed, contrary to the same, I
would give you another chance. We shall have, look you, our friend the
priest in any case, and to get the others is but a matter of time. 'Tis a
good citizen helps the law always; you must have that respect for the law
that you should feel bound to circumvent those who would go counter to it
with your cognisance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My good man,&rdquo; I said, as quietly as I could, and yet internally with
feelings like to break me, &ldquo;I have already said my say. If the tow was
round my thrapple I would say no more than that I am innocent of any plot
against a man by whose family mine have lost, and that I myself, for all
my loyalty to my country, would do much to serve as a private individual.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Consider,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;After all, this Hamilton may be a madman with
nothing at all to tell that will help us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But the bargain is to be that I must pry and I must listen,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
be the tale-pyat whose work may lead to this poor old buffoon's and many
another's slaughtering. Not I, M. Buhot, and thank ye kindly! It's no'
work for one of the Greigs of Hazel Den.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I fear you do not consider all,&rdquo; he said patiently&mdash;so patiently
indeed that I wondered at him. &ldquo;I will show you to what you are condemned
even before your trial, before you make up your mind irrevocably to refuse
this very reasonable request of ours,&rdquo; and he made a gesture that caused
the warder to open the door so that I could see within.
</p>
<p>
There was no light of its own in the cell, but it borrowed wanly a little
of the radiance of the corridor, and I could see that it was bare to the
penury of a mausoleum, with a stone floor, a wooden palliasse, and no
window other than a barred hole above the door. There was not even a stool
to sit on. But I did not quail.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have been in more comfortable quarters, M. Buhot,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but in none
that I could occupy with a better conscience.&rdquo; Assuming with that a sort
of bravado, I stepped in before he asked me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;but I cannot make you my felicitations on your
decision, M. Greig,&rdquo; and without more ado he had the door shut on me.
</p>
<p>
I sat on the woollen palliasse for a while, with my head on my hands,
surrendered all to melancholy; and then, though the thing may seem beyond
belief, I stretched myself and slept till morning. It was not the most
refreshing of sleep, but still 'twas wonderful that I should sleep at all
in such circumstances, and I take it that a moorland life had been a
proper preparation for just such trials.
</p>
<p>
When I wakened in the morning the prison seemed full of eerie noises&mdash;of
distant shrieks as in a bedlam, and commanding voices, and of ringing
metals, the clank of fetters, or the thud of musket-butts upon the stones.
A great beating of feet was in the yard, as if soldiers were manoeuvring,
and it mastered me to guess what all this might mean, until a warder
opened my door and ordered me out for an airing.
</p>
<p>
I mind always of a parrot at a window.
</p>
<p>
This window was one that looked into the yard from some official's
dwelling in that dreadful place, and the bird occupied a great cage that
was suspended from a nail outside.
</p>
<p>
The bird, high above the rabble of rogues in livery, seemed to have a
devilish joy in the spectacle of the misery tramping round and round
beneath, for it clung upon the bars and thrust out its head to whistle, as
if in irony, or taunt us with a foul song. There was one air it had,
expressed so clearly that I picked up air and words with little
difficulty, and the latter ran something like this:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Ah! ah! Pierrot, Pierrot!
Fais ta toilette,
Voila le barbier! oh! oh!
Et sa charrette&mdash;
</pre>
<p>
all in the most lugubrious key.
</p>
<p>
And who were we that heard that reference to the axe? We were the scum,
the <i>sordes</i>, the rot of France. There was, doubtless, no crime
before the law of the land, no outrage against God and man, that had not
here its representative. We were not men, but beasts, cut off from every
pleasant&mdash;every clean and decent association, the visions of sin
always behind the peering eyes, the dreams of vice and crime for ever
fermenting in the low brows. I felt 'twas the forests we should be
frequenting&mdash;the forests of old, the club our weapon, the cave our
habitation; no song ours, nor poem, no children to infect with fondness,
no women to smile at in the light of evening lamps. The forest&mdash;the
cave&mdash;the animal! What were we but children of the outer dark,
condemned from the start of time, our faces ground hard against the
flints, our feet bogged in hag and mire?
</p>
<p>
There must have been several hundreds of the convicts in the yard, and yet
I was told later that it was not a fourth of the misery that Bicêtre held,
and that scores were leaving weekly for the <i>bagnes</i>&mdash;the hulks
at Toulon and at Brest&mdash;while others took their places.
</p>
<p>
Every man wore a uniform&mdash;a coarse brown jacket, vast wide breeches
of the same hue, a high sugar-loaf cap and wooden shoes&mdash;all except
some privileged, whereof I was one&mdash;and we were divided into gangs,
each gang with its warders&mdash;tall grenadiers with their muskets ready.
</p>
<p>
Round and round and across and across we marched in the great quadrangle,
every man treading the rogues' measure with leg-weary reluctance, many
cursing their warders under breath, most scowling, all hopeless and all
lost.
</p>
<p>
'Twas the exercise of the day.
</p>
<p>
As we slouched through that mad ceremony in the mud of the yard, with rain
still drizzling on us, the parrot in its cage had a voice loud and shrill
above the commands of the grenadiers and officers; sang its taunting song,
or whistled like a street boy, a beast so free, so careless and remote,
that I had a fancy it had the only soul in the place.
</p>
<p>
As I say, we were divided into gangs, each gang taking its own course back
and forward in the yard as its commander ordered. The gang I was with
marched a little apart from the rest. We were none of us in this gang in
the ugly livery of the prison, but in our own clothing, and we were, it
appeared, allowed that privilege because we were yet to try. I knew no
reason for the distinction at the time, nor did I prize it very much, for
looking all about the yard&mdash;at the officers, the grenadiers, and
other functionaries of the prison, I failed to see a single face I knew.
What could I conclude but that Buhot was gone and that I was doomed to be
forgotten here?
</p>
<p>
It would have been a comfort even to have got a glimpse of Father
Hamilton, the man whose machinations were the cause of my imprisonment,
but Father Hamilton, if he had been taken here as Buhot had suggested, was
not, at all events, in view.
</p>
<p>
After the morning's exercise we that were the privileged were taken to
what was called the <i>salle dépreuve</i>, and with three or four to each
<i>gamelle</i> or mess-tub, ate a scurvy meal of a thin soup and black
bread and onions. To a man who had been living for a month at heck and
manger, as we say, this might naturally seem unpalatable fare, but truth
to tell I ate it with a relish that had been all the greater had it been
permitted me to speak to any of my fellow sufferers. But speech was
strictly interdict and so our meal was supped in silence.
</p>
<p>
When it was over I was to be fated for the pleasantest of surprises!
</p>
<p>
There came to me a sous-officer of the grenadiers.
</p>
<p>
In French he asked if I was Monsieur Greig. I said as best I could in the
same tongue that I was that unhappy person at his service. Then, said he,
&ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; He led me into a hall about a hundred feet long that had
beds or mattresses for about three hundred people. The room was empty, as
those who occupied it were, he said, at Mass. Its open windows in front
looked into another courtyard from that in which we had been exercising,
while the windows at the rear looked into a garden where already lilac was
in bloom and daffodillies endowed the soil of a few mounds with the colour
of the gold. On the other side of the court first named there was a huge
building. &ldquo;Galbanon,&rdquo; said my guide, pointing to it, and then made me
understand that the same was worse by far than the Bastille, and at the
moment full of Marquises, Counts, Jesuits, and other clergymen, many of
them in irons for abusing or writing against the Marchioness de Pompadour.
</p>
<p>
I listened respectfully and waited Monsieur's explanation. It was manifest
I had not been brought into this hall for the good of my education, and
naturally I concluded the name of Galbanon, that I had heard already from
Buhot, with its villainous reputation, was meant to terrify me into a
submission to what had been proposed. The moment after a hearty meal&mdash;even
of <i>soup maigre</i>&mdash;was not, however, the happiest of times to
work upon a Greig's feelings of fear or apprehension, and so I waited,
very dour within upon my resolution though outwardly in the most
complacent spirit.
</p>
<p>
The hall was empty when we entered as I have said, but we had not been
many minutes in it when the tramp of men returning to it might be heard,
and this hurried my friend the officer to his real business.
</p>
<p>
He whipped a letter from his pocket and put it in my hand with a sign to
compel secrecy on my part. It may be readily believed I was quick enough
to conceal the missive. He had no cause to complain of the face I turned
upon another officer who came up to us, for 'twas a visage of clownish
vacuity.
</p>
<p>
The duty of the second officer, it appeared, was to take me to a new cell
that had been in preparation for me, and when I got there it was with
satisfaction I discovered it more than tolerable, with a sufficiency of
air and space, a good light from the quadrangle, a few books, paper, and a
writing standish.
</p>
<p>
When the door had been shut upon me, I turned to open my letter and found
there was in fact a couple of them&mdash;a few lines from her ladyship in
Dunkerque expressing her continued interest in my welfare and adventures,
and another from the Swiss through whom the first had come. He was still&mdash;said
the honest Bernard&mdash;at my service, having eluded the vigilance of
Buhot, who doubtless thought a lackey scarce worth his hunting, and he was
still in a position to post my letters, thanks to the goodwill of the
sous-officer who was a relative. Furthermore, he was in hopes that Miss
Walkinshaw, who was on terms of intimacy with the great world and
something of an <i>intriguante</i>, would speedily take steps to secure my
freedom. &ldquo;Be tranquil, dear Monsieur!&rdquo; concluded the brave fellow, and I
was so exceedingly comforted and inspired by these matters that I
straightway sat down to the continuation of my journal for Miss
Walkinshaw's behoof. I had scarce dipped the pen, when my cell door opened
and gave entrance to the man who was the cause of my incarceration.
</p>
<p>
The door shut and locked behind him; it was Father Hamilton!
</p>
<p>
It was indeed Father Hamilton, by all appearance none the worse in body
for his violent escapade, so weighty with the most fatal possibilities for
himself, for he advanced to me almost gaily, his hand extended and his
face red and smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Scotland! to my heart!&rdquo; cries he in the French, and throws his arms about
me before I could resist, and kisses me on the cheeks after the amusing
fashion of his nation. &ldquo;La! la! la! Paul,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I'd have wanted
three breakfasts sooner than miss this meeting with my good secretary lad
that is the lovablest rogue never dipped a pen in his master's service.
Might have been dead for all I knew, and run through by a brutal rapier,
victim of mine own innocence. But here's my Paul, <i>pardieu!</i> I would
as soon have my <i>croque-mort</i> now as that jolly dog his uncle, that
never waked till midnight or slept till the dull, uninteresting noon in
the years when we went roving. What! Paul! Paul Greig! my <i>croque-mort!</i>
my Don Dolorous!&mdash;oh, Lord, my child, I am the most miserable of
wretches!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And there he let me go, and threw himself upon a chair, and gave his vast
body to a convulsion of arid sobs. The man was in hysterics, compounding
smiles and sobs a score to the minute, but at the end 'twas the natural
man won the bout, else he had taken a stroke. I stood by him in perplexity
of opinions whether to laugh or storm, whether to give myself to the
righteous horror a good man ought to feel in the presence of a murtherer,
or shrug my shoulders tolerantly at the imbecile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said he, recovering his natural manner, &ldquo;I have made a mortal
enemy of Andrew Greig's nephew. Yes, yes, master, glower at Misery, fat
Misery&mdash;and the devil take it!&mdash;old Misery, without a penny in
'ts pocket, and its next trip upon wheels a trip to the block to nuzzle at
the dirty end in damp sawdust a nose that has appreciated the bouquet of
the rarest wines. Paul, my boy, has't a pinch of snuff? A brutal bird out
there sings a stave of the <i>Chanson de la Veuve</i> so like the
confounded thing that I heard my own foolish old head drop into the
basket, and there! I swear to you the smell of the sawdust is in my
nostrils now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I handed him my box; 'twas a mull my Uncle Andy gave me before he died,
made of the horn of a young bullock, with a blazon of the house on the
silver lid. He took it eagerly and drenched himself with the contents.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, la! la!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I give thanks. My head was like yeast. I wish it
were Christmas last, and a man called Hamilton was back in Dixmunde
parish. But there! that is enough, I have made my bed and I must lie on't,
with a blight on all militant jesuitry! When last I had this box in my
fingers they were as steady as Mont St. Michel, now look&mdash;they are
trembling like aspen, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i> And all that's different is
that I have eaten one or two better dinners and cracked a few pipkins of
better wine, and&mdash;and&mdash;well-nigh killed a police officer. Did'st
ever hear of one Hamilton, M. Greig? 'Twas a cheery old fellow in Dixmunde
whose name was the same as mine, and had a garden and bee-hives, and I am
on the rack for my sins.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He might be on the rack&mdash;and, indeed, I daresay the man was in a
passion of feelings so that he knew not what he was havering about, but
what impressed me most of all about him was that he seemed to have some
momentary gleams of satisfaction in his situation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have every ground of complaint against you, sir,&rdquo; I said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Would'st plague an old man with complaints when
M. de Paris is tapping him on the shoulder to come away and smell the
sawdust of his own coffin? Oh, 'tis not in this wise thy uncle had done,
but no matter!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no wish, Father Hamilton, to revile you for what you have brought
me,&rdquo; I hastened to tell him. &ldquo;That is far from my thoughts, though now
that you put me in mind of it, there is some ground for my blaming you if
blaming was in my intention. But I shall blame you for this, that you are
a priest of the Church and a Frenchman, and yet did draw a murderous hand
upon a prince of your own country.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This took him somewhat aback. He helped himself to another voluminous
pinch of my snuff to give him time for a rejoinder and then&mdash;&ldquo;Regicide,
M. Greig, is sometimes to be defended when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Regicide!&rdquo; I cried, losing all patience, &ldquo;give us the plain English of
it, Father Hamilton, and call it murder. To call it by a Latin name makes
it none the more respectable a crime against the courts of heaven where
the curse of Babel has an end. But for an accident, or the cunning of
others, you had a corpse upon your conscience this day, and your name had
been abhorred throughout the whole of Europe.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He put his shoulders up till his dew-laps fell in massive folds.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Fore God!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here's a treatise in black letter from Andrew
Greig's nephew. It comes indifferently well, I assure thee, from Andrew's
nephew. Those who live in glass houses, <i>cher ami</i>,&mdash;those who
live in glass houses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He tapped me upon the breast with his fat finger and paused, with a
significant look upon his countenance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, ye can out with it, Father Hamilton!&rdquo; I cried, certain I knew his
meaning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Those who live in glass houses,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;should have some pity for a
poor old devil out in the weather without a shelter of any sort.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were about to taunt me with my own unhappy affair,&rdquo; I said, little
relishing his consideration.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was I, M. Greig?&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Faith! a glass residence seems to
breed an ungenerous disposition! If thou can'st credit me I know nothing
of thine affair beyond what I may have suspected from a Greig travelling
hurriedly and in red shoes. I make you my compliments, Monsieur, of your
morality that must be horror-struck at my foolish play with a pistol, yet
thinks me capable of a retort so vile as that you indicate. My dear lad, I
but spoke of what we have spoken of together before in our happy chariot
in the woods of Somme&mdash;thine uncle's fate, and all I expected was,
that remembering the same, thou his nephew would'st have enough tolerance
for an old fool to leave his punishment in the hands of the constitute
authority. <i>Voilà!</i> I wish to heaven they had given me another cell,
after all, that I might have imagined thy pity for one that did thee no
harm, or at least meant to do none, which is the main thing with all our
acts else Purgatory's more crowded than I fancy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He went wearily over to the fire and spread his trembling hands to the
blaze; I looked after him perplexed in my mind, but not without an
overpowering pity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have come, like thyself, doubtless,&rdquo; he said after a little, &ldquo;over vile
roads in a common cart, and lay awake last night in a dungeon&mdash;a
pretty conclusion to my excursion! And yet I am vastly more happy to-day
than I was this time yesterday morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But then you were free,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you had all you need wish for&mdash;money,
a conveyance, servants, leisure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And M' Croque-mort's company,&rdquo; he added with a poor smile. &ldquo;True, true!
But the thing was then to do,&rdquo; and he shuddered. &ldquo;Now my part is done,
'twas by God's grace a failure, and I could sing for content like one of
the little birds we heard the other day in Somme.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He could not but see my bewilderment in my face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You wonder at that,&rdquo; said he, relinquishing the Roman manner as he always
did when most in earnest. &ldquo;Does Monsieur fancy a poor old priest can take
to the ancient art of assassination with an easy mind? <i>Nom de nom!</i>
I could skip to the block like a ballet-dancer if 'twere either that or
live the past two days over again and fifty years after. I have none of
the right stomach for murder; that's flat! 'tis a business that keeps you
awake too much at night, and disturbs the gastric essence; calls, too, for
a confounded agility that must be lacking in a person of my handsome and
plenteous bulk. I had rather go fishing any day in the week than imbrue.
When Buhot entered the room where I waited for a less worthy man and I
fired honestly for my money and missed, I could have died of sheer
rapture. Instead I threw myself upon his breast and embraced him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He said none of that to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Like enough not, but 'tis true none the less, though he may keep so
favourable a fact out of his records. A good soul enough, Buhot! We knew
him, your uncle and I, in the old days when I was thinner and played a
good game of chess at three in the morning. Fancy Ned Hamilton cutting
short the glorious career of old Buhot! I'd sooner pick a pocket.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Or kill a prince!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Felicitations on your wit, M. Greig! Heaven help the elderly when the new
wit is toward! <i>N'importe!</i> Perhaps 'twere better to kill some
princes than to pick a pocket. Is it not better, or less wicked, let us
say, to take the life of a man villainously abusing it than the purse of a
poor wretch making the most of his scanty <i>livres?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And then the priest set out upon his defence. It is too long here to
reproduce in his own words, even if I recalled them, and too specious in
its terms for the patience of the honest world of our time. With his hands
behind his back he marched up and down the room for the space of a
half-hour at the least, recounting all that led to his crime. The tale was
like a wild romance, but yet, as we know now, true in every particular. He
was of the Society of Jesus, had lived a stormy youth, and fallen in later
years into a disrepute in his own parish, and there the heads of his
Society discovered him a very likely tool for their purposes. They had
only half convinced him that the death of Charles Edward was for the glory
of God and the good of the Church when they sent him marching with a
pistol and £500 in bills of exchange and letters of credit upon a chase
that covered a great part of three or four countries, and ended at Lisbon,
when a German Jesuit in the secret gave him ten crusadoes to bring him
home with his task unaccomplished.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have what amounts almost to a genius for losing the opportunities of
which I do not desire to avail myself,&rdquo; said Father Hamilton with a
whimsical smile.
</p>
<p>
And then he had lain in disgrace with the Jesuits for a number of years
until it became manifest (as he confessed with shame) that his experience
of leisure, wealth, and travel had enough corrupted him to make the
prospect of a second adventure of a similar kind pleasing. At that time
Charles, lost to the sight of Europe, and only discovered at brief and
tantalising intervals by the Jesuit agents, scarce slept two nights in the
same town, but went from country to country <i>incognito</i>, so that
'twas no trivial task Father Hamilton undertook to run him to earth.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The difficulty of it&mdash;indeed the small likelihood there was of my
ever seeing him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was what mainly induced me to accept the
office, though in truth it was compelled. I was doing very well at
Dunkerque,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and very happy if I had never heard more of
prince or priesthood, when Father Fleuriau sent me a hurried intimation
that my victim was due at Versailles on Easter and ordered my instant
departure there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The name of Fleuriau recalled me to my senses. &ldquo;Stop, stop, Father
Hamilton!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I must hear no more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he, bitterly, &ldquo;is't too good a young gentleman to listen to
the confession of a happy murderer that has failed at his trade?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no feeling left but pity,&rdquo; said I, almost like to weep at this,
&ldquo;but you have been put into this cell along with me for a purpose.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what might that be, M. Greig?&rdquo; he asked, looking round about him, and
seeing for the first time, I swear, the sort of place he was in. &ldquo;Faith!
it is comfort, at any rate; I scarce noticed that, in my pleasure at
seeing Paul Greig again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must not tell me any more of your Jesuit plot, nor name any of those
involved in the same, for Buhot has been at me to cock an ear to
everything you may say in that direction, and betray you and your friends.
It is for that he has put us together into this cell.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> am not I betrayed enough already?&rdquo; cried the priest,
throwing up his hands. &ldquo;I'll never deny my guilt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but they want the names of your fellow conspirators, and
Buhot says they never expect them directly from you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He does, does he?&rdquo; said the priest, smiling. &ldquo;Faith, M. Buhot has a good
memory for his friend's characteristics. No, M. Greig, if they put this
comfortable carcase to the rack itself. And was that all thy concern?
Well, as I was saying&mdash;let us speak low lest some one be listening&mdash;this
Father Fleuriau-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Again I stopped him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You put me into a hard position, Father Hamilton,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;My freedom&mdash;my
life, perhaps&mdash;depends on whether I can tell them your secret or not,
and here you throw it in my face.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; he asked, simply. &ldquo;I merely wish to show myself largely the
creature of circumstances, and so secure a decent Scot's most favourable
opinion of me before the end.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I might be tempted to betray you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The old eagle looked again out at his eyes. He gently slapped my cheek
with a curious touch of fondness almost womanly, and gave a low, contented
laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Farceur!</i>&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As if I did not know my Don Dolorous, my merry
Andrew's nephew!&rdquo; His confidence hugely moved me, and, lest he should
think I feared to trust myself with his secrets, I listened to the
remainder of his story, which I shall not here set down, as it bears but
slightly on my own narrative, and may even yet be revealed only at cost of
great distress among good families, not only on the Continent but in
London itself.
</p>
<p>
When he had done, he thanked me for listening so attentively to a matter
that was so much on his mind that it gave him relief to share it with some
one. &ldquo;And not only for that, M. Greig,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are my thanks due, for
you saved the life that might have been the prince's instead of my old
gossip, Buhot's. To take the bullet out of my pistol was the device your
uncle himself would have followed in the like circumstances.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I did not do that!&rdquo; I protested.
</p>
<p>
He looked incredulous.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Buhot said as much,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he let it out unwittingly that I had had
my claws clipped by my own household.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then assuredly not by me, Father Hamilton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said he, half incredulous, and a look of speculation came upon his
countenance.

CHAPTER XXIV
</h2>
<h3>
PHILOSOPHY IN A FELON'S CELL
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t seemed for a while as if we were fated to lie forgotten in Bicêtre till
the crack of doom; not that we were many days there when all was done, but
that in our natural hourly expectation at first of being called forth for
trial the hours passed so sluggishly that Time seemed finally to sleep,
and a week, to our fancy&mdash;to mine at all events&mdash;seemed a month
at the most modest computation.
</p>
<p>
I should have lost my reason but for the company of the priest, who, for
considerations best known to others and to me monstrously inadequate, was
permitted all the time to share my cell. In his singular society there was
a recreation that kept me from too feverishly brooding on my wrongs, and
his character every day presented fresh features of interest and
admiration. He had become quite cheerful again, and as content in the
confine of his cell as he had been when the glass coach was jolting over
the early stages of what had been intended for a gay procession round the
courts of Europe. Once more he affected the Roman manner that was due to
his devotion to Shakespeare and L'Estrange's Seneca, and &ldquo;Clarissa
Harlowe,&rdquo; a knowledge of which, next to the Scriptures, he counted the
first essentials for a polite education. I protest he grew fatter every
day, and for ease his corpulence was at last saved the restraint of
buttons, which was an indolent indulgence so much to his liking that of
itself it would have reconciled him to spend the remainder of his time in
prison.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Tiens!</i> Paul,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;here's an old fool has blundered
through the greater part of his life without guessing till now how easy a
thing content is to come by. Why, 'tis no more than a loose waistcoat and
a chemise unbuttoned at the neck. I dared not be happy thus in Dixmunde,
where the folks were plaguily particular that their priest should be
point-devise, as if mortal man had time to tend his soul and keep a
constant eye on the lace of his fall.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And he would stretch himself&mdash;a very mountain of sloth&mdash;in his
chair.
</p>
<p>
With me 'twas different. Even in a gaol I felt sure a day begun untidily
was a day ill-done by. If I had no engagements with the fastidious
fashionable world I had engagements with myself; moreover, I shared my
father's sentiment, that a good day's darg of work with any thinking in it
was never done in a pair of slippers down at the heel. Thus I was as
peijink (as we say) in Bicêtre as I would have been at large in the
genteel world.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not,&rdquo; he would admit, &ldquo;but that I love to see thee in a decent habit, and
so constant plucking at thy hose, for I have been young myself, and had
some right foppish follies, too. But now, my good man Dandiprat, my <i>petit-maître</i>,
I am old&mdash;oh, so old!&mdash;and know so much of wisdom, and have seen
such a confusion of matters, that I count comfort the greatest of
blessings. The devil fly away with buttons and laces! say I, that have
been parish priest of Dixmunde&mdash;and happily have not killed a man nor
harmed a flea, though like enough to get killed myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The weather was genial, yet he sat constantly hugging the fire, and I at
the window, which happily gave a prospect of the yard between our building
and that of Galbanon. I would be looking out there, and perhaps pining for
freedom, while he went prating on upon the scurviest philosophy surely
ever man gave air to.
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/226.jpg" alt="226" width="100%" /><br />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Behold, my scrivener, how little man wants for happiness! My constant
fear in Dixmunde was that I would become so useless for all but eating and
sleeping, when I was old, that no one would guarantee me either; poverty
took that place at my table the skull took among the Romans&mdash;the
thought on't kept me in a perpetual apprehension. <i>Nom de chien!</i> and
this was what I feared&mdash;this, a hard lodging, coarse viands, and sour
wine! What was the fellow's name?&mdash;Demetrius, upon the taking of
Megara, asked Monsieur Un-tel the Philosopher what he had lost. 'Nothing
at all,' said he, 'for I have all that I could call my own about me,' and
yet 'twas no more than the skin he stood in. A cell in Bicêtre would have
been paradise to such a gallant fellow. Oh, Paul, I fear thou may'st be
ungrateful&mdash;I would be looking out there, and perhaps pining for
freedom,&rdquo; he went prating on, &ldquo;to this good Buhot, who has given us such a
fine lodging, and saved us the care of providing for ourselves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis all very well, father,&rdquo; I said, leaning on the sill of the window,
and looking at a gang of prisoners being removed from one part of Galbanon
to another&mdash;&ldquo;'tis all very well, but I mind a priest that thought
jaunting round the country in a chariot the pinnacle of bliss. And that
was no further gone than a fortnight ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said he, and stretched his fat fingers to the fire; &ldquo;he that cannot
live happily anywhere will live happily nowhere at all. What avails
travel, if Care waits like a hostler to unyoke the horses at every stage?
I tell thee, my boy, I never know what a fine fellow is Father Hamilton
till I have him by himself at a fireside; 'tis by firesides all the wisest
notions come to one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish there came a better dinner than to-day's,&rdquo; said I, for we had
agreed an hour ago that smoked soup was not very palatable.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;La! la! la! there goes Sir Gourmet!&rdquo; cried his reverence. &ldquo;Have I
infected this poor Scot that ate naught but oats ere he saw France, with
mine own fever for fine feeding from which, praise <i>le bon Dieu!</i> I
have recovered? 'Tis a brutal entertainment, and unworthy of man, to place
his felicity in the service of his senses. I maintain that even smoked
soup is pleasant enough on the palate of a man with an easy conscience,
and a mind purged of vulgar cares.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you can be happy here, Father Hamilton?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I asked, astonished at such sentiments from a man before so ill to please.
</p>
<p>
He heaved like a mountain in travail, and brought forth a peal of laughter
out of all keeping with our melancholy situation. &ldquo;Happy!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
have never been happy for twenty years till Buhot clapped claw upon my
wrist. Thou may'st have seen a sort of mask of happiness, a false face of
jollity in Dunkerque parlours, and heard a well-simulated laughter now and
then as we drank by wayside inns, but may I be called coxcomb if the
miserable wretch who playacted then was half so light of heart as this
that sits here at ease, and has only one regret&mdash;that he should have
dragged Andrew Greig's nephew into trouble with him. What man can be
perfectly happy that runs the risk of disappointment&mdash;which is the
case of every man that fears or hopes for anything? Here am I, too old for
the flame of love or the ardour of ambition; all that knew me and
understood me best and liked me most are dead long since. I have a state
palace prepared for me free; a domestic in livery to serve my meals;
parishioners do not vex me with their trifling little hackneyed sins, and
my conclusion seems like to come some morning after an omelet and a glass
of wine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I could not withhold a shudder.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But to die that way, Father!&rdquo; I said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>C'est égal!</i>&rdquo; said he, and crossed himself. &ldquo;We must all die
somehow, and I had ever a dread of a stone. Come, come, M. Croque-mort,
enough of thy confounded dolours! I'll be hanged if thou did'st not steal
these shoes, and art after all but an impersonator of a Greig. The lusty
spirit thou call'st thine uncle would have used his teeth ere now to gnaw
his way through the walls of Bicêtre, and here thou must stop to converse
cursedly on death to the fatted ox that smells the blood of the abattoir&mdash;oh
lad, give's thy snuff-box, sawdust again!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thus by the hour went on the poor wretch, resigned most obviously to
whatever was in store for him, not so much from a native courage, I fear,
as from a plethora of flesh that smothered every instinct of
self-preservation. As for me I kept up hope for three days that Buhot
would surely come to test my constancy again, and when that seemed
unlikely, when day after day brought the same routine, the same cell with
Hamilton, the same brief exercise in the yard, the same vulgar struggle at
the <i>gamelle</i> in the <i>salle d'épreuve</i>&mdash;I could have
welcomed Galbanon itself as a change, even if it meant all the horror that
had been associated with it by Buhot and my friend the sous-officer.
</p>
<p>
Galbanon! I hope it has long been levelled with the dust, and even then I
know the ghosts of those there tortured in their lives will habitate the
same in whirling eddies, for a constant cry for generations has gone up to
heaven from that foul spot. It must have been a devilish ingenuity, an
invention of all the impish courts below, that placed me at a window where
Galbanon faced me every hour of the day or night, its horror all revealed.
I have seen in the pool of Earn in autumn weather, when the river was in
spate, dead leaves and broken branches borne down dizzily upon the water
to toss madly in the linn at the foot of the fall; no less helpless, no
less seared by sin and sorrow, or broken by the storms of circumstance,
were the wretches that came in droves to Galbanon. The stream of crime or
tyranny bore them down (some from very high places), cast them into this
boiling pool, and there they eddied in a circle of degraded tasks from
which it seemed the fate of many of them never to escape, though their
luckier fellows went in twos or threes every other day in a cart to their
doom appointed.
</p>
<p>
Be sure it was not pleasant each day for me to hear the hiss of the lash
and the moans of the bastinadoed wretch, to see the blood spurt, and
witness the anguish of the men who dragged enormous bilboes on their
galled ankles.
</p>
<p>
At last I felt I could stand it no longer, and one day intimated to Father
Hamilton that I was determined on an escape.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good lad!&rdquo; he cried, his eye brightening. &ldquo;The most sensible thing thou
hast said in twenty-four hours. 'Twill be a recreation for myself to
help,&rdquo; and he buttoned his waistcoat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We can surely devise some means of breaking out if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We!&rdquo; he repeated, shaking his head. &ldquo;No, no, Paul, thou hast too risky a
task before thee to burden thyself with behemoth. Shalt escape by thyself
and a blessing with thee, but as for Father Hamilton he knows when he is
well-off, and he shall not stir a step out of Buhot's charming and
commodious inn until the bill is presented.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In vain I protested that I should not dream of leaving him there while I
took flight; he would listen to none of my reasoning, and for that day at
least I abandoned the project.
</p>
<p>
Next day Buhot helped me to a different conclusion, for I was summoned
before him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is it that we have here a more discerning
young gentleman than I had the honour to meet last time?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just the very same, M. Buhot,&rdquo; said I bluntly. He chewed the stump of his
pen and shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, M. Greig,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;this is a <i>bêtise</i> of the most
ridiculous. We have given you every opportunity of convincing yourself
whether this Hamilton is a good man or a bad one, whether he is the tool
of others or himself a genius of mischief.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The tool of others, certainly, that much I am prepared to tell you, but
that you know already. And certainly no genius of mischief himself; man!
he has not got the energy to kick a dog.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; said Buhot softly, fancying he had me in the key of
revelation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that's all, M. Buhot,&rdquo; said I, with a carriage he could not mistake.
</p>
<p>
He shrugged his shoulders again, wrote something in a book on the desk
before him with great deliberation and then asked me how I liked my
quarters in Bicêtre.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tolerably well,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I've been in better, but I might be in waur.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He laughed a little at the Scotticism that seemed to recall something&mdash;perhaps
a pleasantry of my uncle's&mdash;to him, and then said he, &ldquo;I'm sorry they
cannot be yours very much longer, M. Greig. We calculated that a week or
two of this priest's company would have been enough to inspire a distaste
and secure his confession, but apparently we were mistaken. You shall be
taken to other quarters on Saturday.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope, M. Buhot,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are to be no worse than those I occupy
now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His face reddened a little at this&mdash;I felt always there was some vein
of special kindness to me in this man's nature&mdash;and he said
hesitatingly, &ldquo;Well, the truth is, 'tis Galbanon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Before a trial?&rdquo; I asked, incredulous.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The trial will come in good time,&rdquo; he said, rising to conclude the
parley, and he turned his back on me as I was conducted out of the room
and back to the cell, where Father Hamilton waited with unwonted agitation
for my tidings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, lad,&rdquo; he cried, whenever we were alone, &ldquo;what stirs? I warrant they
have not a jot of evidence against thee,&rdquo; but in a second he saw from my
face the news was not so happy, and his own face fell.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are to be separated on Saturday,&rdquo; I told him.
</p>
<p>
Tears came to his eyes at that&mdash;a most feeling old rogue!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And where is't for thee, Paul?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where is't for yourself ought to be of more importance to you, Father
Hamilton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it matters little about me, but surely for you it
cannot be Galbanon?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, and it is no less.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then, Paul,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;we must break out, and that without loss of
time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it in the plural this time?&rdquo; I asked him.
</p>
<p>
He affected an indifference, but at the last consented to share the whole
of the enterprise.

CHAPTER XXV
</h2>
<h3>
WE ATTEMPT AN ESCAPE
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ather Hamilton was not aware of the extent of it, but he knew I was in a
correspondence with the sous-officer. More than once he had seen us in the
<i>salle dépreuve</i> in a manifest understanding of each other, though he
had no suspicion that the gentleman was a Mercury for Miss Walkinshaw,
whose name seldom, if ever, entered into our conversation in the cell.
From her I had got but one other letter&mdash;a brief acknowledgment of
some of my fullest budgets, but 'twas enough to keep me at my diurnal on
every occasion almost on which the priest slept. I sent her (with the
strictest injunction to secrecy upon so important a matter) a great deal
of the tale the priest had told me&mdash;not so much for her entertainment
as for the purpose of moving in the poor man's interests. Especially was I
anxious that she should use her influence to have some one communicate to
Father Fleuriau, who was at the time in Bruges, how hazardous was the
position of his unhappy cat's-paw, whose state I pictured in the most
moving colours I could command. There was, it must be allowed, a risk in
entrusting a document so damnatory to any one in Bicêtre, but that the
packet was duly forwarded to its destination I had every satisfaction of
from the sous-officer, who brought me an acknowledgment to that effect
from Bernard the Swiss.
</p>
<p>
The priest knew, then, as I say, that I was on certain terms with this
sous-officer, and so it was with no hesitation I informed him that,
through the favour of the latter, I had a very fair conception of the
character and plan of this building of Bicêtre in which we were interned.
What I had learned of most importance to us was that the block of which
our cell was a part had a face to the main road of Paris, from which
thoroughfare it was separated by a spacious court and a long range of iron
palisades. If ever we were to make our way out of the place it must be in
this direction, for on two sides of our building we were overlooked by
buildings vastly more throng than our own, and bordered by yards in which
were constant sentinels. Our block jutted out at an angle from one very
much longer, but lower by two storeys, and the disposition of both made it
clear that to enter into this larger edifice, and towards the gable end of
it that overlooked the palisades of the Paris road, was our most feasible
method of essay.
</p>
<p>
I drew a plan of the prison and grounds on paper, estimating as best I
might all the possible checks we were like to meet with, and leaving a
balance of chances in our favour that we could effect our purpose in a
night.
</p>
<p>
The priest leaned his chin upon his arms as he lolled over the table on
which I eagerly explained my diagram, and sighed at one or two of the
feats of agility it assumed. There was, for example, a roof to walk upon&mdash;the
roof of the building we occupied&mdash;though how we were to get there in
the first place was still to be decided. Also there was a descent from
that roof on to the lower building at right angles, though where the
ladder or rope for this was to come from I must meanwhile airily leave to
fortune. Finally, there was&mdash;assuming we got into the larger
building, and in some unforeseeable way along its roof and clear to the
gable end&mdash;a part of the yard to cross, and the palisade to escalade.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, lad! thou takest me for a bird,&rdquo; cried his reverence, aghast at all
this. &ldquo;Is thy poor fellow prisoner a sparrow? A little after this I might
do't with my own wings&mdash;the saints guide me!&mdash;but figure you
that at present I am not Philetas, the dwarf, who had to wear leaden shoes
lest the wind should blow him away. 'Twould take a wind indeed to stir
this amplitude of good humours, this sepulchre of twenty thousand good
dinners and incomputible tuns of liquid merriment. Pray, Paul, make an
account of my physical infirmities, and mitigate thy transport of
vaultings and soarings and leapings and divings, unless, indeed, thou
meditatest sewing me up in a sheet, and dragging me through the realms of
space.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We shall manage! we shall manage!&rdquo; I insisted, now quite uplifted in a
fanciful occupation that was all to my tastes, even if nothing came of it,
and I plunged more boldly into my plans. They were favoured by several
circumstances&mdash;the first, namely, that we were not in the uniform of
the prison, and, once outside the prison, could mingle with the world
without attracting attention. Furthermore, by postponing the attempt till
the morrow night I could communicate with the Swiss, and secure his
cooperation outside in the matter of a horse or a vehicle, if the same
were called for. I did not, however, say so much as that to his reverence,
whom I did not wish as yet to know of my correspondence with Bernard.
Finally, we had an auspicious fact at the outset of our attempt, inasmuch
as the cell we were in was in the corridor next to that of which the
sous-officer had some surveillance, and I knew his mind well enough now to
feel sure he would help in anything that did not directly involve his own
position and duties. In other words, he was to procure a copy of the key
of our cell, and find a means of leaving it unlocked when the occasion
arose.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A copy of the key, Paul!&rdquo; said Father Hamilton; &ldquo;sure there are no bounds
to thy cheerful mad expectancy! But go on! go on! art sure he could not be
prevailed on&mdash;this fairy godfather&mdash;to give us an escort of
cavalry and trumpeters?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is not much of a backing-up, Father Hamilton,&rdquo; I said, annoyed at
his skeptic comments upon an affair that involved so much and agitated
myself so profoundly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon! Paul,&rdquo; he said hastily, confused and vexed himself at the
reproof. &ldquo;Art quite right, I'm no more than a croaker, and for penance I
shall compel myself to do the wildest feat thou proposest.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We determined to put off the attempt at escape till I had communicated
with the sous-officer (in truth, though Father Hamilton did not know it,
till I had communicated with Bernard the Swiss), and it was the following
afternoon I had not only an assurance of the unlocked door, but in my hand
a more trustworthy plan of the prison than my own, and the promise that
the Swiss would be waiting with a carriage outside the palisades when we
broke through, any time between midnight and five in the morning.
</p>
<p>
Next day, then, we were in a considerable agitation; to that extent indeed
that I clean forgot that we had no aid to our descent of twenty or thirty
feet (as the sous-sergeant's diagram made it) from the roof of our block
on to that of the one adjoining. We had had our minds so much on bolted
doors and armed sentinels that this detail had quite escaped us until
almost on the eve of setting out at midnight, the priest began again to
sigh about his bulk and swear no rope short of a ship's cable would serve
to bear him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Rope!&rdquo; I cried, in a tremendous chagrin at my stupidity. &ldquo;Lord! if I have
not quite forgot it. We have none.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps it is not necessary. Perhaps my heart is so light
at parting with my <i>croque-mort</i> that I can drop upon the tiles like
a pigeon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Parting,&rdquo; I repeated, eyeing him suspiciously, for I thought perhaps he
had changed his mind again. &ldquo;Who thinks of parting?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not I indeed,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;unless the rope do when thou hast got it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was no rope, however, and I cursed my own folly that I had not asked
one from the sous-officer whose complaisance might have gone the length of
a fathom or two, though it did not, as the priest suggested, go so far as
an armed convoy and a brace of trumpeters. It was too late now to repair
the overlook, and to the making of rope the two of us had there and then
to apply ourselves, finding the sheets and blankets-of our beds scanty
enough for our purpose, and by no means of an assuring elegance or
strength when finished. But we had thirty feet of some sort of cord at the
last, and whether it was elegant or not it had to do for our purpose.
</p>
<p>
Luckily the night was dark as pitch and a high wind roared in the
chimneys, and in the numerous corners of the prison. There was a sting in
the air that drew many of the sentinels round the braziers flaming in the
larger yard between the main entrance and the buildings, and that further
helped our prospects; so that it was with some hope, in spite of a heart
that beat like a flail in my breast, I unlocked the door and crept out
into the dimly-lighted corridor with the priest close behind me.
</p>
<p>
Midway down this gallery there was a stair of which our plan apprised us,
leading to another gallery&mdash;the highest of the block&mdash;from which
a few steps led to a cock-loft where the sous-officer told us there was
one chance in a score of finding a blind window leading to the roof.
</p>
<p>
No one, luckily, appeared as we hurried down the long gallery. I darted
like a fawn up the stair to the next flat, Father Hamilton grievously
puffing behind me, and we had just got into the shadow of the steps
leading to the cock-loft when a warder's step and the clank of his chained
keys came sounding down the corridor. He passed within three feet of us
and I felt the blood of all my body chill with fear!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I told thee, lad,&rdquo; whispered the priest, mopping the sweat from his face,
&ldquo;I told thee 'twas an error to burden thyself with such a useless carcase.
Another moment or two&mdash;a gasp for the wind that seems so cursed ill
to come by at my years, and I had brought thee into trouble.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I paid no heed to him, but crept up the steps and into the cock-loft that
smelt villainously of bats.
</p>
<p>
The window was unfastened! I stuck out my head upon the tiles and sniffed
the fine fresh air of freedom as it had been a rare perfume.
</p>
<p>
Luckily the window was scarcely any height, and it proved easy to aid his
reverence into the open air. Luckily, further, it was too dark for him to
realise the jeopardies of his situation for whether his precarious
gropings along the tiles were ten feet or thirty from the yard below was
indiscoverable in the darkness. He slid his weighty body along with an
honest effort that was wholly due to his regard for my interests, because
'twas done with groans and whispered protestations that 'twas the maddest
thing for a man to leave a place where he was happy and risk his neck in
an effort to discover misery. A rime of frost was on the tiles, and they
were bitter cold to the touch. One fell, too, below me as I slid along,
and rattled loudly over its fellows and plunged into the yard.
</p>
<p>
Naturally we stopped dead and listened breathless, a foolish action for
one reason because in any case we had been moving silently at a great
height above the place where the tile should fall so that there was no
risk of our being heard or seen, but our listening discovered so great an
interval between the loosening of the tile and its dull shattering on the
stones below that the height on which we were perched in the darkness was
made more plain&mdash;more dreadful to the instincts than if we could
actually measure it with the eye. I confess I felt a touch of nausea, but
nothing compared with the priest, whose teeth began to chitter in an ague
of horror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good Lord, Paul!&rdquo; he whispered to me, clutching my leg as I moved in
front of him, &ldquo;it is the bottomless pit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not unless we drop,&rdquo; said I. And to cheer him up I made some foolish
joke.
</p>
<p>
If the falling tile attracted any attention in the yard it was not
apparent to us, and five minutes later we had to brace ourselves to a
matter that sent the tile out of our minds.
</p>
<p>
For we were come to the end of the high building, and twenty feet below
us, at right angles, we could plainly see the glow of several skylights in
the long prison to which it was attached. It was now the moment for our
descent on the extemporised rope.

CHAPTER XXVI
</h2>
<h3>
A RIMEY NIGHT ON ROOF-TOPS, AND A NEW USE FOR AN OLD KIRK BELL
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> fastened the rope about a chimney-head with some misgivings that by the
width and breadth of the same I was reducing our chance of ever getting
down to the lower building, as the knotted sheets from the outset had been
dubious measure for the thirty feet of which my sous-officer had given the
estimate. But I said never a word to the priest of my fears on that score,
and determined for once to let what was left of honesty go before
well-fattened age and test the matter first myself. If the cord was too
brief for its purpose, or (what was just as likely) on the frail side, I
could pull myself back in the one case as the priest was certainly unfit
to do, and in the other my weight would put less strain upon it than that
of Father Hamilton.
</p>
<p>
I can hear him yet in my imagination after forty years, as he clung to the
ridge of the roof like a seal on a rock, chittering in the cold night
wind, enviously eyeing some fires that blazed in another yard and groaning
melancholiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A garden,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and six beehives&mdash;no, 'faith! 'twas seven last
summer, and a roomful of books. Oh, Paul, Paul! Now I know how God cast
out Satan. He took him from his warm fireside, and his books before they
were all read, and his pantoufles, and set him straddling upon a frozen
house-top to ponder through eternal night upon the happy past. Alas, poor
being! How could he know what joys were in the simplicity of a room of
books half-read and a pair of warm old slippers?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He was fair rambling in his fears, my poor priest, and I declare scarcely
knew the half of what he uttered, indeed he spoke out so loudly that I had
to check him lest he should attract attention from below.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Father Hamilton,&rdquo; said I, when my cord was fastened, &ldquo;with your
permission I'll try it first. I want to make it sure that my seamanship on
the sloop <i>Sarah</i>, of Ayr, has not deserted me to the extent that I
cannot come down a rope without a ratline or tie a bowling knot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, Paul, certainly,&rdquo; said he, quite eagerly, so that I was
tempted for a second to think he gladly postponed his own descent from
sheer terror.
</p>
<p>
I threw over the free end of the cord and crouched upon the beak of the
gable to lower myself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Paul,&rdquo; said his reverence in a broken voice. &ldquo;Let us say 'good-bye'
in case aught should happen ere we are on the same level again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said I, impatient, &ldquo;that's the true <i>croque-mort</i> spirit
indeed! Why, Father, it isn't&mdash;it isn't&mdash;&rdquo; I was going to say it
was not a gallows I was venturing on, but the word stuck in my throat, for
a certain thought that sprung to me of how nearly in my own case it had
been to the very gallows, and his reverence doubtless saw some delicacy,
for he came promptly to my help.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a priest's promise&mdash;made to be broken, you would say, good
Paul,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I promised the merriest of jaunts over Europe in a coach,
and here my scrivener is hanging in the reins! Pardon, dear Scotland, <i>milles
pardons</i> and good-bye and good luck.&rdquo; And at that he made to embrace
me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's a French ceremony just about nothing at all,&rdquo; I thought, and began
my descent. The priest lay on his stomach upon the ridge. As I sank, with
my eyes turned upwards, I could see his hair blown by the wind against a
little patch of stars, that was the only break in the Ethiopia of the sky.
He seemed to follow my progress breathlessly, and when I gained the other
roof and shook the cord to tell him so he responded by a faint clapping of
his hands.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Art all right, lad?&rdquo; he whispered down to me, and I bade him follow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good-night, Paul, good-bye, and God bless you!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Get out of
this as quick as you can; 'tis more than behemoth could do in a month of
dark nights, and so I cut my share of the adventure. One will do't when
two (and one of them a hogshead) will die in trying to do't.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Here was a pretty pickle! The man's ridiculous regard for my safety
outweighed his natural inclinations, though his prospects in the prison of
Bicêtre were blacker than my own, having nothing less dreadful than an
execution at the end of them. He had been merely humouring me so far&mdash;and
such a brave humouring in one whose flesh was in a quaking of alarms all
the time he slid along the roof!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you not coming?&rdquo; I whispered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary, I'm going, dear Paul,&rdquo; said he with a pretence at
levity. &ldquo;Going back to my comfortable cell and my uniformed servant and M.
Buhot, the charmingest of hostellers, and I declare my feet are like ice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I firmly, &ldquo;I go back too. I'll be eternally cursed if I give
up my situation as scrivener at this point. I must e'en climb up again.&rdquo;
 And with that I prepared to start the ascent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; said he without a second's pause, &ldquo;stop where you are and
I'll go down. Though 'tis the most stupendous folly,&rdquo; he added with a
sigh, and in a moment later I saw his vast bulk laboriously heaving over
the side of the roof. Fortunately the knots in the cord where the
fragments of sheet and blanket were joined made his task not so difficult
as it had otherwise been, and almost as speedily as I had done it myself
he reached the roof of the lower building, though in such a state he
quivered like a jelly, and was dumb with fear or with exertion when the
thing was done.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said at last, when he had recovered himself. &ldquo;Art a fool to be so
particular about an old carcase accursed of easy humours and accused of
regicide. Take another thought on't, Paul. What have you to do with this
wretch of a priest that brought about the whole trouble in your ignorance?
And think of Galbanon!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Think of the devil! Father Hamilton,&rdquo; I snapped at him, &ldquo;every minute we
waste havering away here adds to the chances against any of us getting
free, and I am sure that is not your desire. The long and the short of it
is that I'll not stir a step out of Bicêtre&mdash;no, not if the doors
themselves were open&mdash;unless you consent to come with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ventre Dieu!</i>&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;'tis just such a mulish folly as I might
have looked for from the nephew of Andrew Greig. But lead on, good
imbecile, lead on, and blame not poor Father Hamilton if the thing ends in
a fiasco!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We now crawled along a roof no whit more easily traversed than that we had
already commanded. Again and again I had to stop to permit my companion to
come up on me, for the pitch of the tiles was steep, and he in a peril
from his own lubricity, and it was necessary even to put a hand under his
arm at times when he suffered a vertigo through seeing the lights in the
yard deep down as points of flame.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad! boy,&rdquo; he said, and his perspiring hand clutching mine at one of our
pauses, &ldquo;I thrill at the very entrails. I'd liefer have my nose in the
sawdust any day than thrash through thin air on to a paving-stone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A minute or two more and we are there,&rdquo; I answered him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said he, starting; &ldquo;in purgatory?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look up, man!&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;There's a window beaming ten yards off.&rdquo; And
again I pushed on.
</p>
<p>
In very truth there was no window, though I prayed as fervently for one as
it had been a glimpse of paradise, but I was bound to cozen the old man
into effort for his own life and for mine. What I had from the higher
building taken for the glow of skylights had been really the light of
windows on the top flat of the other prison block, and its roof was wholly
unbroken. At least I had made up my mind to that with a despair benumbing
when I touched wood. My fingers went over it in the dark with frantic
eagerness. It was a trap such as we had come out of at the other block,
but it was shut. Before the priest could come up to me and suffer the
fresh horror of disappointment I put my weight upon it, and had the good
fortune to throw it in. The flap fell with a shriek of hinges and showed
gaping darkness. We stretched upon the tiles as close as limpets and as
silent. Nothing stirred within.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A garden,&rdquo; said he in a little, &ldquo;as sweet as ever bean grew in, with the
rarest plum-tree; and now I am so cold.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could be doing with some of your complaint,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;as for me, I'm on
fire. Please heaven, you'll be back in the garden again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I lowered myself within, followed by the priest, and found we were upon
the rafters. A good bit off there was a beam of light that led us,
groping, and in an imminent danger of going through the plaster, to an
air-hole over a little gallery whose floor was within stretch as I lowered
myself again.
</p>
<p>
Father Hamilton squeezed after me; we both looked over the edge of the
gallery, and found it was a chapel we were in!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Sacré nom!</i>&rdquo; said the priest and crossed himself, with a
genuflexion to the side of the altar.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Lord! Paul,&rdquo; he said, whispering, &ldquo;if 'twere the Middle Ages, and
this were indeed a sanctuary, how happy was a poor undeserving son of
Mother Church! Even Dagobert's hounds drew back from the stag in St.
Denys.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was a mean interior, as befitted the worship of the <i>misérables</i>
who at times would meet there. A solemn quiet held the place, that seemed
wholly deserted; the dim light that had shown through the air-hole and
guided us came from some candles dripping before a shrine.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Heaven help us!&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;I know just such another.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was nobody in the church so far as we could observe from the little
gallery in which we found ourselves, but when we had gone down a flight of
steps into the body of the same, and made to cross towards the door, we
were suddenly confronted by a priest in a white cope. My heart jumped to
my mouth; I felt a prinkling in the roots of my hair, and stopped dumb,
with all my faculties basely deserted from me. Luckily Father Hamilton
kept his presence of mind. As he told me later, he remembered of a sudden
the Latin proverb that in battles the eye is first overcome, and he fixed
the man in the stole with a glance that was bold and disconcerting. As it
happened, however, the other priest was almost as blind as a bat, and saw
but two civil worshippers in his chapel. He did not even notice that it
was a <i>soutane</i>; he passed peeringly, with a bow to our inclinations,
and it was almost incredulous of our good fortune I darted out of the
chapel into the darkness of a courtyard of equal extent with that I had
crossed on the night of my first arrival at Bicêtre. At its distant end
there were the same flaming braziers with figures around them, and the
same glitter of arms.
</p>
<p>
Now this Bicêtre is set upon a hill and commands a prospect of the city of
Paris, of the Seine and its environs. For that reason we could see to our
right the innumerable lights of a great plain twinkling in the darkness,
and it seemed as if we had only to proceed in that direction to secure
freedom by the mere effort of walking. As we stood in the shadow of the
chapel, Father Hamilton eyed the distant prospect of the lighted town with
a singular rapture.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Paris!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Oh, Dieu! and I thought never to clap an eye on't
again. Paris, my Paul! Behold the lights of it&mdash;<i>la ville lumière</i>
that is so fine I could spend eternity in it. Hearts are there, lad, kind
and jocund-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And meditating a descent on unhappy Britain,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good neighbourly hearts, or I'm a gourd else,&rdquo; he went on, unheeding my
interruption. &ldquo;The stars in heaven are not so good, are no more notably
the expression of a glowing and fraternal spirit. There is laughter in the
streets of her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not at this hour, Father Hamilton,&rdquo; said I, and the both of us always
whispering. &ldquo;I've never seen the place by day nor put a foot in it, but it
will be droll indeed if there is laughter in its streets at two o'clock in
the morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Paul, shall we ever get there?&rdquo; said he longingly. &ldquo;We can but try,
anyway. I certainly did not come all this way, Father Hamilton, just to
look on the lowe of Paris.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
What had kept us shrinking in the shadow of the chapel wall had been the
sound of footsteps between us and the palisades that were to be
distinguished a great deal higher than I had expected, on our right. On
the other side of the rails was freedom, as well as Paris that so greatly
interested my companion, but the getting clear of them seemed like to be a
more difficult task than any we had yet overcome, and all the more
hazardous because the footsteps obviously suggested a sentinel. Whether it
was the rawness of the night that tempted him to a relaxation, or whether
he was not strictly on duty, I know not, but, while we stood in the most
wretched of quandaries, the man who was in our path very soon ceased his
perambulation along the palisades, and went over to one of the distant
fires, passing within a few yards of us as we crouched in the darkness.
When he had gone sufficiently out of the way we ran for it. So plain were
the lights of the valley, so flimsy a thing had seemed to part us from the
high-road there, that never a doubt intruded on my mind that now we were
as good as free, and when I came to the rails I beat my head with my hands
when the nature of our folly dawned upon me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We may just go back,&rdquo; I said to the priest in a stricken voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Comment?</i>&rdquo; said he, wiping his brow and gloating on the spectacle
of the lighted town.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; I said, indicating the railings that were nearly three times my
own height, &ldquo;there are no convenient trap-doors here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But the cord&mdash;&rdquo; said he simply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;the cord's where we left it snugly tied with a bowling
knot to the chimney of our block, and I'm an ass.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, poor Paul!&rdquo; said the priest in a prostration at this divulgence of
our error. &ldquo;I'm the millstone on your neck, for had I not parleyed at the
other end of the cord when you had descended, the necessity for it would
never have escaped your mind. I gave you fair warning, lad, 'twas a
quixotic imbecility to burden yourself with me. And are we really at a
stand? God! look at Paris. Had I not seen these lights I had not cared for
myself a straw, but, oh lord! lad, they are so pleasant and so close! Why
will the world sleep when two unhappy wretches die for want of a little
bit of hemp?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are not to blame,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;one rope was little use to us in any
case. But anyhow I do not desire to die of a little bit of hemp if I can
arrange it better.&rdquo; And I began hurriedly to scour up and down the
palisade like a trapped mouse. It extended for about a hundred yards,
ending at one side against the walls of a gate-house or lodge; on the
other side it concluded at the wall of the chapel. It had no break in all
its expanse, and so there was nothing left for us to do but to go back the
way we had come, obliterate the signs of our attempt and find our cells
again. We went, be sure, with heavy hearts, again ventured into the
chapel, climbed the stairs, went through the ceiling, and stopped a little
among the rafters to rest his reverence who was finding these manoeuvres
too much for his weighty body. While he sat regaining sufficient strength
to resume his crawling on rimey tiles I made a search of the loft we were
in and found it extended to the gable end of the chapel, but nothing more
for my trouble beyond part of a hanging chain that came through the roof
and passed through the ceiling. I had almost missed it in the darkness,
and even when I touched it my first thought was to leave it alone. But I
took a second thought and tried the lower end, which came up as I hauled,
yard upon yard, until I had the end of it, finished with a bell-ringer's
hempen grip, in my hands. Here was a discovery if bell-pulls had been made
of rope throughout in Bicêtre prison! But a chain with an end to a bell
was not a thing to be easily borrowed.
</p>
<p>
I went back to where Father Hamilton was seated on the rafters, and told
him my discovery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A bell,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Faith! I never liked them. Pestilent inventions of the
enemy, that suggested duties to be done and the fleeting hours. But a
bell-rope implies a belfry on the roof and a bell in it, and the chain
that may reach the ground within the building may reach the same desirable
place without the same.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's very true,&rdquo; said I, struck with the thing. And straight got
through the trap and out upon the roof again. Father Hamilton puffed after
me and in a little we came upon a structure like a dovecot at the very
gable-end. &ldquo;The right time to harry a nest is at night,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for then
you get all that's in it.&rdquo; And I started to pull up the chain that was
fastened to the bell.
</p>
<p>
I lowered behemoth with infinite exertion till he reached the ground
outside the prison grounds in safety, wrapped the clapper of the bell in
my waistcoat, and descended hand over hand after him.
</p>
<p>
We were on the side of a broad road that dipped down the hill into a
little village. Between us and the village street, across which hung a
swinging lamp, there mounted slowly a carriage with a pair of horses.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bernard!&rdquo; I cried, running up to it, and found it was the Swiss in the
very article of waiting for us, and he speedily drove us into Paris.

CHAPTER XXVII
</h2>
<h3>
WE ENTER PARIS AND FIND A SANCTUARY THERE
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>f the town of Paris that is so lamentably notable in these days I have
but the recollection that one takes away from a new scene witnessed under
stress of mind due to matters more immediately affecting him than the
colour, shape, and properties of things seen, and the thought I had in
certain parts of it is more clear to me to-day than the vision of the
place itself. It is, in my mind, like a fog that the bridges thundered as
our coach drove over them with our wretched fortunes on that early morning
of our escape from Bicêtre, but as clear as when it sprung to me from the
uproar of the wheels comes back the dread that the whole of this community
would be at their windows looking out to see what folks untimeously
disturbed their rest. We were delayed briefly at a gate upon the walls; I
can scarcely mind what manner of men they were that stopped us and thrust
a lantern in our faces, and what they asked eludes me altogether, but I
mind distinctly how I gasped relief when we were permitted to roll on.
Blurred, too&mdash;no better than the surplusage of dreams, is my first
picture of the river and its isles in the dawn, but, like a favourite
song, I mind the gluck of waters on the quays and that they made me think
of Earn and Cart and Clyde.
</p>
<p>
We stopped in the place of the Notre Dame at the corner of a street; the
coach drove off to a <i>remise</i> whence it had come, and we went to an
hospital called the Hôtel Dieu, in the neighbourhood, where Hamilton had a
Jesuit friend in one of the heads, and where we were accommodated in a
room that was generally set aside for clergymen. It was a place of the
most wonderful surroundings, this Hôtel Dieu, choked, as it were, among
towers, the greatest of them those of Our Lady itself that were in the
Gothic taste, regarding which Father Hamilton used to say, &ldquo;<i>Dire
gothique, c'est dire mauvais gout</i>,&rdquo; though, to tell the truth, I
thought the building pretty braw myself. Alleys and wynds were round about
us, and so narrow that the sky one saw between them was but a ribbon by
day, while at night they seemed no better than ravines.
</p>
<p>
'Twas at night I saw most of the city, for only in the darkness did I dare
to venture out of the Hôtel Dieu. Daundering my lone along the cobbles, I
took a pleasure in the exercise of tenanting these towering lands with
people having histories little different from the histories of the folks
far off in my Scottish home&mdash;their daughters marrying, their sons
going throughither (as we say), their bairns wakening and crying in their
naked beds, and grannies sitting by the ingle-neuk cheerfully cracking
upon ancient days. Many a time in the by-going I looked up their pend
closes seeking the eternal lovers of our own burgh towns and never finding
them, for I take it that in love the foreign character is coyer than our
own. But no matter how eagerly I went forth upon my nightly airing in a <i>roquelaure</i>
borrowed from Father Hamilton's friend, the adventure always ended, for
me, in a sort of eerie terror of those close-hemming walls, those tangled
lanes where slouched the outcast and the ne'er-do-weel, and not even the
glitter of the moon upon the river between its laden isles would comfort
me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;La! la! la!&rdquo; would Father Hamilton cry at me when I got home with a face
like a fiddle. &ldquo;Art the most ridiculous rustic ever ate a cabbage or set
foot in Arcady. Why, man! the woman must be wooed&mdash;this Mademoiselle
Lutetia. Must take her front and rear, walk round her, ogling bravely.
Call her dull! call her dreadful! <i>Ciel!</i> Has the child never an eye
in his mutton head? I avow she is the queen of the earth this Paris. If I
were young and wealthy I'd buy the glittering stars in constellations and
turn them into necklets for her. With thy plaguey gift of the sonnet I'd
deave her with ecstasies and spill oceans of ink upon leagues of paper to
tell her about her eyes. Go to! Scotland, go to! Ghosts! ghosts! devil the
thing else but ghosts in thy rustic skull, for to take a fear of Lutetia
when her black hair is down of an evening and thou canst not get a glimpse
of that beautiful neck that is rounded like the same in the Psyche of
Praxiteles. Could I pare off a portion of this rotundity and go out in a
masque as Apollo I'd show thee things.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And all he saw of Paris himself was from the windows of the hospital,
where he and I would stand by the hour looking out into the square. For
the air itself he had to take it in a little garden at the back,
surrounded by a high wall, and affording a seclusion that even the priest
could avail himself of without the hazard of discovery. He used to sit in
an arbour there in the warmth of the day, and it was there I saw another
trait of his character that helped me much to forget his shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
Over his head, within the doorway of the bower, he hung a box and placed
therein the beginnings of a bird's nest. The thing was not many hours done
when a pair of birds came boldly into his presence as he sat silent and
motionless in the bower, and began to avail themselves of so excellent a
start in householding. In a few days there were eggs in the nest, and
'twas the most marvellous of spectacles to witness the hen sit content
upon them over the head of the fat man underneath, and the cock, without
concern, fly in and out attentive on his mate.
</p>
<p>
But, indeed, the man was the friend of all helpless things, and few of the
same came his way without an instinct that told them it was so. Not the
birds in the nest alone were at ease in his society; he had but to walk
along the garden paths whistling and chirping, and there came flights of
birds about his head and shoulders, and some would even perch upon his
hand. I have never seen him more like his office than when he talked with
the creatures of the air, unless it was on another occasion when two
bairns, the offspring of an inmate in the hospital, ventured into the
garden, finding there another child, though monstrous, who had not lost
the key to the fields where blossom the flowers of infancy, and frolic is
a prayer.
</p>
<p>
But he dare not set a foot outside the walls of our retreat, for it was as
useless to hide Ballageich under a Kilmarnock bonnet as to seek a disguise
for his reverence in any suit of clothes. Bernard would come to us rarely
under cover of night, but alas! there were no letters for me now, and mine
that were sent through him were fewer than before. And there was once an
odd thing happened that put an end to these intromissions; a thing that
baffled me to understand at the time, and indeed for many a day
thereafter, but was made plain to me later on in a manner that proved how
contrary in his character was this mad priest, that was at once assassin
and the noblest friend.
</p>
<p>
Father Hamilton was not without money, though all had been taken from him
at Bicêtre. It was an evidence of the width and power of the Jesuit
movement that even in the Hôtel Dieu he could command what sums he needed,
and Bernard was habituated to come to him for moneys that might pay for
himself and the coachman and the horses at the <i>remise</i>. On the last
of these occasions I took the chance to slip a letter for Miss Walkinshaw
into his hand. Instead of putting it in his pocket he laid it down a
moment on a table, and he and I were busy packing linen for the wash when
a curious cry from Father Hamilton made us turn to see him with the letter
in his hand.
</p>
<p>
He was gazing with astonishment on the direction.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and so my Achilles is not consoling himself exclusively
with the Haemonian lyre, but has taken to that far more dangerous
instrument the pen. The pen, my child, is the curse of youth. When we are
young we use it for our undoing, and for the facture of regrets for after
years&mdash;even if it be no more than the reading of our wives' letters
that I'm told are a bitter revelation to the married man. And so&mdash;and
so, Monsieur Croque-mort keeps up a correspondence with the lady. H'm!&rdquo; He
looked so curiously and inquiringly at me that I felt compelled to make an
explanation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is quite true, Father Hamilton,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;After all, you gave me so
little clerkly work that I was bound to employ my pen somehow, and how
better than with my countrywoman?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis none of my affair&mdash;perhaps,&rdquo; he said, laying down the letter.
&ldquo;And yet I have a curiosity. Have we here the essential Mercury?&rdquo; and he
indicated Bernard who seemed to me to have a greater confusion than the discovery
gave a cause for.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bernard has been good enough,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You discover two Scots, Father
Hamilton, in a somewhat sentimental situation. The lady did me the honour
to be interested in my little travels, and I did my best to keep her
informed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He turned away as he had been shot, hiding his face, but I saw from his
neck that he had grown as white as parchment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What in the world have I done?&rdquo; thinks I, and concluded that he was angry
for my taking the liberty to use the dismissed servant as a go-between. In
a moment or two he turned about again, eying me closely, and at last he
put his hand upon my shoulder as a schoolmaster might do upon a boy's.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My good Paul,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how old are you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Twenty-one come Martinmas,&rdquo; I said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Expiscate! elucidate! 'Come Martinmas,'&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and what does that
mean? But no matter&mdash;twenty-one says my barbarian; sure 'tis a right
young age, a very baby of an age, an age in frocks if one that has it has
lived the best of his life with sheep and bullocks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I said, indignant, &ldquo;I was in very honest company among the same
sheep and bullocks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said he, and put up his hand, eying me with compassion and
kindness. &ldquo;If thou only knew it, lad, thou art due me a civil attention at
the very least. Sure there is no harm in my mentioning that thou art
mighty ingenuous for thy years. 'Tis the quality I would be the last to
find fault with, but sometimes it has its inconveniences. And Bernard&rdquo;&mdash;he
turned to the Swiss who was still greatly disturbed&mdash;&ldquo;Bernard is a
somewhat older gentleman. Perhaps he will say&mdash;our good Bernard&mdash;if
he was the person I have to thank for taking the sting out of the wasp,
for extracting the bullet from my pistol? Ah! I see he is the veritable
person. Adorable Bernard, let that stand to his credit!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then Bernard fell trembling like a saugh tree, and protested he did but
what he was told.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And a good thing, too,&rdquo; said the priest, still very pale but with no
displeasure. &ldquo;And a good thing too, else poor Buhot, that I have seen an
infinity of headachy dawns with, had been beyond any interest in cards or
prisoners. For that I shall forgive you the rest that I can guess at. Take
Monsieur Grog's letter where you have taken the rest, and be gone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Swiss went out much crestfallen from an interview that was beyond my
comprehension.
</p>
<p>
When he was gone Father Hamilton fell into a profound meditation, walking
up and down his room muttering to himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, I never had such a problem presented to me before,&rdquo; said he,
stopping his walk; &ldquo;I know not whether to laugh or swear. I feel that I
have been made a fool of, and yet nothing better could have happened. And
so my Croque-mort, my good Monsieur Propriety, has been writing the lady?
I should not wonder if he thought she loved him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing so bold,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You might without impropriety have seen every
one of my letters, and seen in them no more than a seaman's log.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A seaman's log!&rdquo; said he, smiling faintly and rubbing his massive chin;
&ldquo;nothing would give the lady more delight, I am sure. A seaman's log! And
I might have seen them without impropriety, might I? That I'll swear was
what her ladyship took very good care to obviate. Come now, did she not
caution thee against telling me of this correspondence?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I confessed it was so; that the lady naturally feared she might be made
the subject of light talk, and I had promised that in that respect she
should suffer nothing for her kindly interest in a countryman.
</p>
<p>
The priest laughed consumedly at this.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Interest in her countryman!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Oh, lad, wilt be the death of me
for thy unexpected spots of innocence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And as to that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you must have had a sort of correspondence with
her yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;<i>Comment!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be quite frank with you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it has been the cause of some
vexatious thoughts to me that the letter I carried to the Prince was
directed in Miss Walkinshaw's hand of write, and as Buhot informed me, it
was the same letter that was to wile his Royal Highness to his fate in the
Rue des Reservoirs.&rdquo; Father Hamilton groaned, as he did at any time the
terrible affair was mentioned.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is true, Paul, quite true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but the letter was a forgery.
I'll give the lady the credit to say she never had a hand in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am glad to hear that, for it removes some perplexities that have
troubled me for a while back.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and your perplexities and mine are not over even now, poor
Paul. This Bernard is like to be the ruin of me yet. For you, however, I
have no fear, but it is another matter with the poor old fool from
Dixmunde.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His voice broke, he displayed thus and otherwise so troubled a mind and so
great a reluctance to let me know the cause of it that I thought it well
to leave him for a while and let him recover his old manner.
</p>
<p>
To that end I put on my coat and hat and went out rather earlier than
usual for my evening walk.

CHAPTER XXVIII
</h2>
<h3>
THE MAN WITH THE TARTAN WAISTCOAT
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the first of May. But for Father Hamilton's birds, and some scanty
signs of it in the small garden, the lengthened day and the kindlier air
of the evenings, I might never have known what season it was out of the
almanac, for all seasons were much the same, no doubt, in the Isle of the
City where the priest and I sequestered. 'Twas ever the shade of the
tenements there; the towers of the churches never greened nor budded; I
would have waited long, in truth, for the scent of the lilac and the
chatter of the rook among these melancholy temples.
</p>
<p>
Till that night I had never ventured farther from the gloomy vicinity of
the hospital than I thought I could safely retrace without the necessity
of asking any one the way; but this night, more courageous, or perhaps
more careless than usual, I crossed the bridge of Notre Dame and found
myself in something like the Paris of the priest's rhapsodies and the same
all thrilling with the passion of the summer. It was not flower nor tree,
though these were not wanting, but the spirit in the air&mdash;young girls
laughing in the by-going with merriest eyes, windows wide open letting out
the sounds of songs, the pavements like a river with zesty life of
Highland hills when the frosts above are broken and the overhanging boughs
have been flattering it all the way in the valleys.
</p>
<p>
I was fair infected. My step, that had been unco' dull and heavy, I fear,
and going to the time of dirges on the Isle, went to a different tune; my
being rhymed and sang. I had got the length of the Rue de Richelieu and
humming to myself in the friendliest key, with the good-natured people
pressing about me, when of a sudden it began to rain. There was no close
in the neighbourhood where I could shelter from the elements, but in front
of me was the door of a tavern called the Tête du Duc de Burgoyne shining
with invitation, and in I went.
</p>
<p>
A fat wife sat at a counter; a pot-boy, with a cry of &ldquo;V'ià!&rdquo; that was
like a sheep's complaining, served two ancient citizens in skull-caps that
played the game of dominoes, and he came to me with my humble order of a
litre of ordinary and a piece of bread for the good of the house.
</p>
<p>
Outside the rain pelted, and the folks upon the pavement ran, and
by-and-by the tavern-room filled up with shelterers like myself and kept
the pot-boy busy. Among the last to enter was a group of five that took a
seat at another corner of the room than that where I sat my lone at a
little table. At first I scarcely noticed them until I heard a word of
Scots. I think the man that used it spoke of &ldquo;gully-knives,&rdquo; but at least
the phrase was the broadest lallands, and went about my heart.
</p>
<p>
I put down my piece of bread and looked across the room in wonder to see
that three of the men were gazing intently at myself. The fourth was hid
by those in front of him; the fifth that had spoken had a tartan waistcoat
and eyes that were like a gled's, though they were not on me. In spite of
that, 'twas plain that of me he spoke, and that I was the object of some
speculation among them.
</p>
<p>
No one that has not been lonely in a foreign town, and hungered for
communion with those that know his native tongue, can guess how much I
longed for speech with this compatriot that in dress and eye and accent
brought back the place of my nativity in one wild surge of memory. Every
bawbee in my pocket would not have been too much to pay for such a
privilege, but it might not be unless the overtures came from the persons
in the corner.
</p>
<p>
Very deliberately, though all in a commotion within, I ate my piece and
drank my wine before the stare of the three men, and at last, on the
whisper of one of them, another produced a box of dice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said the man with the tartan waistcoat hurriedly, with a glance
from the tail of his eye at me, but they persisted in their purpose and
began to throw. My countryman in tartan got the last chance, of which he
seemed reluctant to avail himself till the one unseen said: &ldquo;<i>Vous avez
le de''</i>, Kilbride.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kilbride! the name was the call of whaups at home upon the moors!
</p>
<p>
He laughed, shook, and tossed carelessly, and then the laugh was all with
them, for whatever they had played for he had seemingly lost and the dice
were now put by.
</p>
<p>
He rose somewhat confused, looked dubiously across at me with a reddening
face, and then came over with his hat in his hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon, Monsieur,&rdquo; he began; then checked the French, and said: &ldquo;Have I a
countryman here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is like enough,&rdquo; said I, with a bow and looking at his tartan. &ldquo;I am
from Scotland myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He smiled at that with a look of some relief and took a vacant chair on
the other side of my small table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have come better speed with my impudence,&rdquo; said he in the Hielan'
accent, &ldquo;than I expected or deserved. My name's Kilbride&mdash;MacKellar
of Kilbride&mdash;and I am here with another Highland gentleman of the
name of Grant and two or three French friends we picked up at the door of
the play-house. Are you come off the Highlands, if I make take the
liberty?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My name is lowland,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I hail from the shire of Renfrew.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, with a vanity that was laughable. &ldquo;What a pity! I wish you
had been Gaelic, but of course you cannot help it being otherwise, and
indeed there are many estimable persons in the lowlands.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And a great wheen of Highland gentlemen very glad to join them there
too,&rdquo; said I, resenting the implication.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said he heartily. &ldquo;There is no occasion for
offence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Confound the offence, Mr. MacKellar!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Do you not think I am just
too glad at this minute to hear a Scottish tongue and see a tartan
waistcoat? Heilan' or Lowlan', we are all the same&rdquo; when our feet are off
the heather.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; he corrected, &ldquo;but still and on we understand each other.
You must be thinking it gey droll, sir, that a band of strangers in a
common tavern would have the boldness to stare at you like my friends
there, and toss a dice about you in front of your face, but that is the
difference between us. If I had been in your place I would have thrown the
jug across at them, but here I am not better nor the rest, because the
dice fell to me, and I was one that must decide the wadger.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, and was I the object of a wadger?&rdquo; said I, wondering what we were
coming to.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, and that you were,&rdquo; said he shamefacedly, &ldquo;and I'm affronted to
tell it. But when Grant saw you first he swore you were a countryman, and
there was some difference of opinion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what, may I ask, did Kilbride side with?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he promptly, &ldquo;I had never a doubt about that. I knew you were
Scots, but what beat me was to say whether you were Hielan' or Lowlan'.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;And how, if it's a fair question, did you come to the conclusion that I
was a countryman of any sort?&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
He laughed softly, and &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could never make any mistake
about that, whatever of it. There's many a bird that's like the woodcock,
but the woodcock will aye be kennin' which is which, as the other man
said. Thae bones were never built on bread and wine. It's a French coat
you have there, and a cockit hat (by your leave), but to my view you were
as plainly from Scotland as if you had a blue bonnet on your head and a
sprig of heather in your lapels. And here am I giving you the strange
cow's welcome (as the other man said), and that is all inquiry and no
information. You must just be excusing our bit foolish wadger, and if the
proposal would come favourably from myself, that is of a notable family,
though at present under a sort of cloud, as the other fellow said, I would
be proud to have you share in the bottle of wine that was dependent upon
Grant's impudent wadger. I can pass my word for my friends there that they
are all gentry like ourselves&mdash;of the very best, in troth, though not
over-nice in putting this task on myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I would have liked brawly to spend an hour out any company than my own,
but the indulgence was manifestly one involving the danger of discovery;
it was, as I told myself, the greatest folly to be sitting in a tavern at
all, so MacKellar's manner immediately grew cold when he saw a swithering
in my countenance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he, reddening and rising, &ldquo;of course, every gentleman
has his own affairs, and I would be the last to make a song of it if you
have any dubiety about my friends and me. I'll allow the thing looks very
like a gambler's contrivance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, Mr. MacKellar,&rdquo; said I hurriedly, unwilling to let us part like
that, &ldquo;I'm swithering here just because I'm like yoursel' of it and under
a cloud of my own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dod! Is that so?&rdquo; said he quite cheerfully again, and clapping down,
&ldquo;then I'm all the better pleased that the thing that made the roebuck swim
the loch&mdash;and that's necessity&mdash;as the other man said, should
have driven me over here to precognosce you. But when you say you are
under a cloud, that is to make another way of it altogether, and I will
not be asking you over, for there is a gentleman there among the five of
us who might be making trouble of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you a brother in Glasgow College?&rdquo; says I suddenly, putting a
question that had been in my mind ever since he had mentioned his name.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, and I have that,&rdquo; said he quickly, &ldquo;but now he is following the
law in Edinburgh, where I am in the hopes it will be paying him better
than ever it paid me that has lost two fine old castles and the best part
of a parish by the same. You'll not be sitting there and telling me surely
that you know my young brother Alasdair?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Man! him and me lodged together in Lucky Grant's, in Crombie's Land in
the High Street, for two Sessions,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said MacKellar. &ldquo;And you'll be the lad that snow-balled the bylie,
and your name will be Greig?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As he said it he bent to look under the table, then drew up suddenly with
a startled face and a whisper of a whistle on his lips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; said he, in a cautious tone, &ldquo;and that beats all. You'll be
the lad that broke jyle with the priest that shot at Buhot, and there you
are, you <i>amadain</i>, like a gull with your red brogues on you, crying
'come and catch me' in two languages. I'm telling you to keep thae feet of
yours under this table till we're out of here, if it should be the morn's
morning. No&mdash;that's too long, for by the morn's morning Buhot's men
will be at the Hôtel Dieu, and the end of the story will be little talk
and the sound of blows, as the other man said.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Every now and then as he spoke he would look over his shoulder with a
quick glance at his friends&mdash;a very anxious man, but no more anxious
than Paul Greig.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you tell me you ken all that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ken a lot more than that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but that's the latest of my
budget, and I'm giving it to you for the sake of the shoes and my brother
Alasdair, that is a writer in Edinburgh. There's not two Scotchmen
drinking a bowl in Paris town this night that does not ken your
description, and it's kent by them at the other table there&mdash;where
better?&mdash;but because you have that coat on you that was surely made
for you when you were in better health, as the other man said, and because
your long trams of legs and red shoes are under the table there's none of
them suspects you. And now that I'm thinking of it, I would not go near
the hospital place again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! but the priest's there,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and it would never do for me to be
leaving him there without a warning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A warning!&rdquo; said MacKellar with contempt. &ldquo;I'm astonished to hear you,
Mr. Greig. The filthy brock that he is!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you're one of the Prince's party,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and it has every look of
it, or, indeed, whether you are or not, I'll allow you have some cause to
blame Father Hamilton, but as for me, I'm bound to him because we have
been in some troubles together.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's all this about 'bound to him'?&rdquo; said MacKellar with a kind of
sneer. &ldquo;The dog that's tethered with a black pudding needs no pity, as the
other man said, and I would leave this fellow to shift for himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I'll not be doing that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it's your business, and let me tell you that
you're nothing but a fool to be tangled up with the creature. That's
Kilbride's advice to you. Let me tell you this more of it, that they're
not troubling themselves much about you at all now that you have given
them the information.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Information!&rdquo; I said with a start. &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He prepared to join his friends, with a smile of some slyness, and gave me
no satisfaction on the point.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You'll maybe ken best yourself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I'm thinking your name
will have to be Robertson and yourself a decent Englishman for my friends
on the other side of the room there. Between here and yonder I'll have to
be making up a bonny lie or two that will put them off the scent of you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A bonny lie or two seemed to serve the purpose, for their interest in me
appeared to go no further, and by-and-by, when it was obvious that there
would be no remission of the rain, they rose to go.
</p>
<p>
The last that went out of the door turned on the threshold and looked at
me with a smile of recognition and amusement.
</p>
<p>
It was Buhot!

CHAPTER XXIX

<h3>
WHEREIN THE PRIEST LEAVES ME, AND I MAKE AN INLAND VOYAGE
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hat this marvel betokened was altogether beyond my comprehension, but the
five men were no sooner gone than I clapped on my hat and drew up the
collar of my coat and ran like fury through the plashing streets for the
place that was our temporary home. It must have been an intuition of the
raised that guided me; my way was made without reflection on it, at pure
hazard, and yet I landed through a multitude of winding and bewildering
streets upon the Isle of the City and in front of the Hôtel Dieu in a much
shorter time than it had taken me to get from there to the Duke of
Burgundy's Head.
</p>
<p>
I banged past the doorkeeper, jumped upstairs to the clergyman's quarters,
threw open the door and&mdash;found Father Hamilton was gone!
</p>
<p>
About the matter there could be no manner of dubiety, for he had left a
letter directed to myself upon the drawers-head.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My Good Paul (said the epistle, that I have kept till now as a memorial
of my adventure): When you return you will discover from this that I have
taken leave <i>a l'anglaise</i>, and I fancy I can see my secretary
looking like the arms of Bourges (though that is an unkind imputation).
'Tis fated, seemingly, that there shall be no rest for the sole of the
foot of poor Father Hamilton. I had no sooner got to like a loose collar,
and an unbuttoned vest, and the seclusion of a cell, than I must be
plucked out; and now when my birds&mdash;the darlings!&mdash;are on the
very point of hatching I must make adieux. <i>Oh! la belle équipée!</i> M.
Buhot knows where I am&mdash;that's certain, so I must remove myself, and
this time I do not propose to burden M. Paul Greig with my company, for it
will be a miracle if they fail to find me. As for my dear Croque-mort, he
can have the glass coach and Jacques and Bernard, and doubtless the best
he can do with them is to take all to Dunkerque and leave them there. I
myself, I go <i>sans trompette</i>, and no inquiries will discover to him
where I go.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As a postscript he added, &ldquo;And 'twas only a sailor's log, dear lad! My
poor young Paul!&rdquo; When I read the letter I was puzzled tremendously, and
at first I felt inclined to blame the priest for a scurvy flitting to rid
himself of my society, but a little deliberation convinced me that no such
ignoble consideration was at the bottom of his flight. If I read his
epistle aright the step he took was in my own interest, though how it
could be so there was no surmising. In any case he was gone; his friend in
the hospital told me he had set out behind myself, and taken a candle with
him and given a farewell visit to his birds, and almost cried about them
and about myself, and then departed for good to conceal himself, in some
other part of the city, probably, but exactly where his friend had no way
of guessing. And it was a further evidence of the priest's good feeling to
myself (if such were needed) that he had left a sum of a hundred livres
for me towards the costs of my future movements.
</p>
<p>
I left the Hôtel Dieu at midnight to wander very melancholy about the
streets for a time, and finally came out upon the river's bank, where some
small vessels hung at a wooden quay. I saw them in moonlight (for now the
rain was gone), and there rose in me such a feeling as I had often
experienced as a lad in another parish than the Mearns, to see the road
that led from strangeness past my mother's door. The river seemed a
pathway out of mystery and discontent to the open sea, and the open sea
was the same that beat about the shores of Britain, and my thought took
flight there and then to Britain, but stopped for a space, like a wearied
bird, upon the town Dunkerque. There is one who reads this who will judge
kindly, and pardon when I say that I felt a sort of tenderness for the
lady there, who was not only my one friend in France, so far as I could
guess, but, next to my mother, the only woman who knew my shame and still
retained regard for me. And thinking about Scotland and about Dunkerque,
and seeing that watery highway to them both, I was seized with a great
repugnance for the city I stood in, and felt that I must take my feet from
there at once. Father Hamilton was lost to me: that was certain. I could
no more have found him in this tanglement of streets and strange faces
than I could have found a needle in a haystack, and I felt disinclined to
make the trial. Nor was I prepared to avail myself of his offer of the
coach and horses, for to go travelling again in them would be to court
Bicêtre anew.
</p>
<p>
There was a group of busses or barges at the quay, as I have said, all
huddled together as it were animals seeking warmth, with their bows
nuzzling each other, and on one of them there were preparations being made
for her departure. A cargo of empty casks was piled up in her, lights were
being hung up at her bow and stern, and one of her crew was ashore in the
very act of casting off her ropes. At a flash it occurred to me that I had
here the safest and the speediest means of flight.
</p>
<p>
I ran at once to the edge of the quay and clumsily propounded a question
as to where the barge was bound for.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Rouen or thereabouts,&rdquo; said the master.
</p>
<p>
I asked if I could have a passage, and chinked my money in my pocket.
</p>
<p>
My French might have been but middling, but Lewis d'Or talks in a language
all can understand.
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes later we were in the fairway of the river running down through
the city which, in that last look I was ever fated to have of it, seemed
to brood on either hand of us like bordering hills, and at morning we were
at a place by name Triel.
</p>
<p>
Of all the rivers I have seen I must think the Seine the finest. It runs
in loops like my native Forth, sometimes in great, wide stretches that
have the semblance of moorland lochs. In that fine weather, with a sun
that was most genial, the country round about us basked and smiled. We
moved upon the fairest waters, by magic gardens, and the borders of
enchanted little towns. Now it would be a meadow sloping backward from the
bank, where reeds were nodding, to the horizon; now an orchard standing
upon grass that was the rarest green, then a village with rusty roofs and
spires and the continual chime of bells, with women washing upon stones or
men silent upon wherries fishing. Every link of the river opened up a
fresher wonder; if not some poplared isle that had the invitation to a
childish escapade, 'twould be another town, or the garden of a château,
maybe, with ladies walking stately on the lawns, perhaps alone, perhaps
with cavaliers about them as if they moved in some odd woodland minuet. I
can mind of songs that came from open windows, sung in women's voices; of
girls that stood drawing water and smiled on us as we passed, at home in
our craft of fortune, and still the lucky roamers seeing the world so
pleasantly without the trouble of moving a step from our galley fire.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes in the middle of the days we would stop at a red-faced, ancient
inn, with bowers whose tables almost had their feet dipped in the river,
and there would eat a meal and linger on a pot of wine while our barge
fell asleep at her tether and dreamt of the open sea. About us in these
inns came the kind country-people and talked of trivial things for the
mere sake of talking, because the weather was sweet and God so gracious;
homely sounds would waft from the byres and from the barns&mdash;the laugh
of bairns, the whistle of boys, the low of cattle.
</p>
<p>
At night we moored wherever we might be, and once I mind of a place called
Andelys, selvedged with chalky cliffs and lorded over by a castle called
Gaillard, that had in every aspect of it something of the clash of weapons
and of trumpet-cry. The sky shone blue through its gaping gables and its
crumbling windows like so many eyes; the birds that wheeled all round it
seemed to taunt it for its inability. The old wars over, the deep fosse
silent, the strong men gone&mdash;and there at its foot the thriving town
so loud with sounds of peaceful trade! Whoever has been young, and has the
eye for what is beautiful and great and stately, must have felt in such a
scene that craving for companionship that tickles like a laugh within the
heart&mdash;that longing for some one to feel with him, and understand,
and look upon with silence. In my case 'twas two women I would have there
with me just to look upon this Gaillard and the town below it.
</p>
<p>
Then the bending, gliding river again, the willow and the aspen edges, the
hazy orchards and the emerald swards; hamlets, towns, farm-steadings,
châteaux, kirks, and mills; the flying mallard, the leaping perch, the
silver dawns, the starry nights, the ripple of the water in my dreams, and
at last the city of Rouen. My ship of fortune went no further on.
</p>
<p>
I slept a night in an inn upon the quay, and early the next morning,
having bought a pair of boots to save my red shoes, I took the road over a
hill that left Rouen and all its steeples, reeking at the bottom of a
bowl. I walked all day, through woods and meadows and trim small towns and
orchards, and late in the gloaming came upon the port of Havre de Grace.
</p>
<p>
The sea was sounding there, and the smell of it was like a salutation. I
went out at night from my inn, and fairly joyed in its propinquity, and
was so keen on it that I was at the quay before it was well daylight. The
harbour was full of vessels. It was not long ere I got word of one that
was in trim for Dunkerque, to which I took a passage, and by favour of
congenial weather came upon the afternoon of the second day.
</p>
<p>
Dunkerque was more busy with soldiers than ever, all the arms of France
seemed to be collected there, and ships of war and flat-bottomed boats
innumerable were in the harbour.
</p>
<p>
At the first go-off I made for the lodgings I had parted from so
unceremoniously on the morning of that noisy glass coach.
</p>
<p>
The house, as I have said before, was over a baker's shop, and was reached
by a common outer stair that rose from a court-yard behind. Though
internally the domicile was well enough, indeed had a sort of
old-fashioned gentility, and was kept by a woman whose man had been a
colonel of dragoons, but now was a tippling pensioner upon the king, and
his own wife's labours, it was, externally, somewhat mean, the place a
solid merchant of our own country might inhabit, but scarce the place
wherein to look for royal blood. What was my astonishment, then, when, as
I climbed the stair, I came face to face with the Prince!
</p>
<p>
I felt the stair swing off below me and half distrusted my senses, but I
had the presence of mind to take my hat off.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Bon jour, Monsieur</i>, said he, with a slight hiccough, and I saw
that he was flushed and meant to pass with an evasion. There and then a
daft notion to explain myself and my relations with the priest who had
planned his assassination came to me, and I stopped and spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Royal Highness&mdash;-&rdquo; I began, and at that he grew purple.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Cest un drôle de corps!</i>&rdquo; said he, and, always speaking in French,
said he again:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You make an error, Monsieur; I have not the honour of Monsieur's
acquaintance,&rdquo; and looked at me with a bold eye and a disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Greig,&rdquo; I blurted, a perfect lout, and surely as blind as a mole that
never saw his desire, &ldquo;I had the honour to meet your Royal Highness at
Versailles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My Royal Highness!&rdquo; said he, this time in English. &ldquo;I think Monsieur
mistakes himself.&rdquo; And then, when he saw how crestfallen I was, he smiled
and hiccoughed again. &ldquo;You are going to call on our good Clancarty,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;In that case please tell him to translate to you the proverb, <i>Oui
phis sait plus se tait</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no necessity, Monsieur,&rdquo; I answered promptly. &ldquo;Now that I look
closer I see I was mistaken. The person I did you the honour to take you
for was one in whose opinion (if he took the trouble to think of me at
all) I should have liked to re-establish myself, that was all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In spite of his dissipation there was something noble in his manner&mdash;a
style of the shoulders and the hands, a poise of the head that I might
practise for years and come no closer on than any nowt upon my father's
fields. It was that which I remember best of our engagement on the stair,
and that at the last of it he put out his hand to bid me good-day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is Monsieur Albany so long as I am in Dunkerque. <i>À
bon entendeur salut!</i> I hope we may meet again, Monsieur Greig.&rdquo; He
looked down at the black boots I had bought me in Rouen. &ldquo;If I might take
the liberty to suggest it,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;I should abide by the
others. I have never seen their wearer wanting wit, <i>esprit</i>, and
prudence&mdash;which are qualities that at this moment I desire above all
in those that count themselves my friends.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And with that he was gone. I watched him descend the remainder of the
stair with much deliberation, and did not move a step myself until the tip
of his scabbard had gone round the corner of the close.

<h3>
A GUID CONCEIT OF MYSELF LEADS ME FAR ASTRAY
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>lancarty and Thurot were playing cards, so intent upon that recreation
that I was in the middle of the floor before they realised who it was the
servant had ushered in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu! Monsieur Blanc-bec! Il n'y a pas de petit chez soi!</i>&rdquo;
 cried Thurot, dropping his hand, and they jumped to their feet to greet
me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll be hanged if you want assurance, child,&rdquo; said Clancarty, surveying
me from head to foot as if I were some curiosity. &ldquo;Here's your exploits
ringing about the world, and not wholly to your credit, and you must walk
into the very place where they will find the smallest admiration.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not meaning the lodging of Captain Thurot,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Whatever my
reputation may be with the world, I make bold to think he and you will
believe me better than I may seem at the first glance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The first glance!&rdquo; cried his lordship. &ldquo;Gad, the first glance suggests
that Bicêtre agreed with our Scotsman. Sure, they must have fed you on
oatmeal. I'd give a hatful of louis d'or to see Father Hamilton, for if he
throve so marvellously in the flesh as his secretary he must look like the
side of St. Eloi. One obviously grows fat on regicide&mdash;fatter than a
few poor devils I know do upon devotion to princes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thurot's face assured me that I was as welcome there as ever I had been.
He chid Clancarty for his badinage, and told me he was certain all along
that the first place I should make for after my flight from Bicêtre (of
which all the world knew) would be Dunkerque. &ldquo;And a good thing too, M.
Greig,&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not so good,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;but what I must meet on your stair the very man-&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried, and put his finger on his lip. &ldquo;In these parts we know
only a certain M. Albany, who is, my faith! a good friend of your own if
you only knew it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely see how that can be,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;If any man has a cause to
dislike me it is his Roy&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;M. Albany,&rdquo; corrected Thurot.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is M. Albany, for whom, it seems, I was the decoy in a business that
makes me sick to think on. I would expect no more than that he had gone
out there to send the officers upon my heels, and for me to be sitting
here may be simple suicide.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Clancarty laughed. &ldquo;Tis the way of youth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to attach far too
much importance to itself. Take our word for it, M. Greig, all France is
not scurrying round looking for the nephew of Andrew Greig. Faith, and I
wonder at you, my dear Thurot, that has an Occasion here&mdash;a veritable
Occasion&mdash;and never so much as says bottle. Stap me if I have a
friend come to me from a dungeon without wishing him joy in a glass of
burgundy!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The burgundy was forthcoming, and his lordship made the most of it, while
Captain Thurot was at pains to assure me that my position was by no means
so bad as I considered it. In truth, he said, the police had their own
reasons for congratulating themselves on my going out of their way. They
knew very well, as M. Albany did, that I had been the catspaw of the
priest, who was himself no better than that same, and for that reason as
likely to escape further molestation as I was myself.
</p>
<p>
Thurot spoke with authority, and hinted that he had the word of M. Albany
himself for what he said. I scarcely knew which pleased me best&mdash;that
I should be free myself or that the priest should have a certain security
in his concealment.
</p>
<p>
I told them of Buhot, and how oddly he had shown his complacence to his
escaped prisoner in the tavern of the Duke of Burgundy's Head. At that
they laughed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Buhot!&rdquo; cried his lordship. &ldquo;My faith! Ned must have been tickled to see
his escaped prisoner in such a cosy <i>cachette</i> as the Duke's Head,
where he and I, and Andy Greig&mdash;ay! and this same priest&mdash;tossed
many a glass, <i>Ciel!</i> the affair runs like a play. All it wants to
make this the most delightful of farces is that you should have Father
Hamilton outside the door to come in at a whistle. Art sure the fat old
man is not in your waistcoat pocket? Anyhow, here's his good health....&rdquo;

<h3>
THE DUEL IN THE AUBERGE GARDEN
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hoever it was that moved at the instigation of Madame on my behalf, he
put speed into the business, for the very next day I was told my
sous-lieutenancy was waiting at the headquarters of the regiment. A
severance that seemed almost impossible to me before I learned from the
lady's own lips that her heart was elsewhere engaged was now a thing to
long for eagerly, and I felt that the sooner I was out of Dunkerque and
employed about something more important than the tying of my hair and the
teasing of my heart with thinking, the better for myself. Teasing my
heart, I say, because Miss Walkinshaw had her own reasons for refusing to
see me any more, and do what I might I could never manage to come face to
face with her. Perhaps on the whole it was as well, for what in the world
I was to say to the lady, supposing I were privileged, it beats me now to
fancy. Anyhow, the opportunity never came my way, though, for the few days
that elapsed before I departed from Dunkerque, I spent hours in the Rue de
la Boucherie sipping sirops on the terrace of the Café Coignet opposite
her lodging, or at night on the old game of humming ancient love-songs to
her high and distant window. All I got for my pains were brief and
tantalising glimpses of her shadow on the curtains; an attenuate kind of
bliss it must be owned, and yet counted by Master Red-Shoes (who suffered
from nostalgia, not from love, if he had had the sense to know it) a very
delirium of delight.
</p>
<p>
One night there was an odd thing came to pass. But, first of all, I must
tell that more than once of an evening, as I would be in the street and
staring across at Miss Walkinshaw's windows, I saw his Royal Highness in
the neighbourhood. His cloak might be voluminous, his hat dragged down
upon the very nose of him, but still the step was unmistakable. If there
had been the smallest doubt of it, there came one evening when he passed
me so close in the light of an oil lamp that I saw the very blotches on
his countenance. What was more, he saw and recognised me, though he passed
without any other sign than the flash of an eye and a halfstep of
hesitation.

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;H'm,&rdquo; thinks I, &ldquo;here's Monsieur Albany looking as if he might, like
myself, be trying to content himself with the mere shadows of things.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He saw me more than once, and at last there came a night when a fellow in
drink came staving down the street on the side I was on and jostled me in
the by-going without a word of apology.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Pardonnez, Monsieur!</i>&rdquo; said I in irony, with my hat off to give him
a hint at his manners.
</p>
<p>
He lurched a second time against me and put up his hand to catch my chin,
as if I were a wench, &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu! Monsieur Blanc-bec</i>, 'tis time you
were home,&rdquo; said he in French, and stuttered some ribaldry that made me
smack his face with an open hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I saw his Royal Highness in the neighbourhood&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At once he sobered with suspicious suddenness if I had had the sense to
reflect upon it, and gave me his name and direction as one George Bonnat,
of the Marine. &ldquo;Monsieur will do me the honour of a meeting behind the
Auberge Cassard after <i>petit dejeuner</i> to-morrow,&rdquo; said he, and named
a friend. It was the first time I was ever challenged. It should have rung
in the skull of me like an alarm, but I cannot recall at this date that my
heart beat a stroke the faster, or that the invitation vexed me more than
if it had been one to the share of a bottle of wine. &ldquo;It seems a pretty
ceremony about a cursed impertinence on the part of a man in liquor,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;but I'm ready to meet you either before or after petit déjeuner, as
it best suits you, and my name's Greig, by your leave.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well, Monsieur Greig,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;except that you stupidly impede the
pavement and talk French like a Spanish cow (<i>comme une vache espagnole</i>),
you seem a gentleman of much accommodation. Eight o'clock then, behind the
<i>auberge</i>,&rdquo; and off went Sir Ruffler, singularly straight and
business-like, with a profound <i>congé</i> for the unfortunate wretch he
planned to thrust a spit through in the morning.
</p>
<p>
I went home at once, to find Thurot and Clancarty at lansquenet. They were
as elate at my story as if I had been asked to dine with Louis.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Gad, 'tis an Occasion!&rdquo; cried my lord, and helped himself, as usual, with
a charming sentiment: &ldquo;<i>A demain les affaires sérieuses</i>; to-night
we'll pledge our friend!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thurot evinced a flattering certainty of my ability to break down M.
Bonnat's guard in little or no time. &ldquo;A crab, this Bonnat,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why
he should pick a quarrel with you I cannot conceive, for 'tis well known
the man is M. Albany's creature. But, no matter, we shall tickle his ribs,
M. Paul. <i>Ma foi!</i> here's better gaming than your pestilent cards.
I'd have every man in the kingdom find an affair for himself once a month
to keep his spleen in order.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This one's like to put mine very much out of order with his iron,&rdquo; I
said, a little ruefully recalling my last affair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Thurot, &ldquo;after all my lessons! And this Bonnat a crab too!
Fie! M. Paul. And what an he pricks a little? a man's the better for some
iron in his system now and then. Come, come, pass down these foils, my
lord, and I shall supple the arms of our Paul.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We had a little exercise, and then I went to bed. The two sat in my room,
and smoked and talked till late in the night, while I pretended to be fast
asleep. But so far from sleep was I, that I could hear their watches
ticking in their fobs. Some savagery, some fearful want of soul in them,
as evidenced by their conversation, horrified me. It was no great matter
that I was to risk my life upon a drunkard's folly, but for the first time
since I had come into the port of Dunkerque, and knew these men beside my
bed, there intruded a fiery sense of alienation. It seemed a dream&mdash;a
dreadful dream, that I should be lying in a foreign land, upon the eve,
perhaps, of my own death or of another manslaughter, and in a
correspondence with two such worldly men as those that sat there recalling
combats innumerable with never a thought of the ultimate fearful
retribution. Compared with this close room, where fumed the wine and weed,
and men with never a tie domestic were paying away their lives in the
small change of trivial pleasures, how noble and august seemed our old
life upon the moors!
</p>
<p>
When they were gone I fell asleep and slept without a break till Thurot's
fingers drummed reveille on my door. I jumped into the sunshine of a
lovely day that streamed into the room, soused my head in water and in a
little stood upon the street with my companion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Bon matin</i>, Paul!&rdquo; he cried cheerfully. &ldquo;Faith, you sleep sur <i>les
deux oreilles</i>, and we must be marching briskly to be at M. Bonnat's
rendezvous at eight o'clock.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We went through the town and out upon its edge at the Calais road. The sky
was blue like another sea; the sea itself was all unvexed by wave; a
sweeter day for slaughtering would pass the wit of man to fancy. Thurot
hummed an air as he walked along the street, but I was busy thinking of
another morning in Scotland, when I got a bitter lesson I now seemed
scandalously soon to have forgotten. By-and-by we came to the inn. It
stood by itself upon the roadside, with a couple of workmen sitting on a
bench in front dipping their morning crusts in a common jug of wine.
Thurot entered and made some inquiry; came out radiant. &ldquo;Monsieur is not
going to disappoint us, as I feared,&rdquo; said he; and led me quickly behind
the <i>auberge</i>. We passed through the yard, where a servant-girl
scoured pots and pans and sang the while as if the world were wholly
pleasant in that sunshine; we crossed a tiny rivulet upon a rotten plank
and found ourselves in an orchard. Great old trees stood silent in the
finest foggy grass, their boughs all bursting out into blossom, and the
air scent-thick-ened; everywhere the birds were busy; it seemed a world of
piping song. I thought to myself there could be no more incongruous place
nor season for our duelling, and it was with half a gladness I looked
around the orchard, finding no one there.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bah! our good Bonnat's gone!&rdquo; cried Thurot, vastly chagrined and tugging
at his watch. &ldquo;That comes of being five minutes too late, and I cannot, by
my faith, compliment the gentleman upon his eagerness to meet you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was mistaken but for a second; then I spied my fiery friend of the
previous evening lying on his back beneath the oldest of the trees, his
hat tilted over his eyes, as if he had meant to snatch a little sleep in
spite of the dazzling sunshine. He rose to his feet on our approach, swept
off his hat courteously, and hailed Thurot by name.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, you, Antoine! I am ravished! For, look you, the devil's in all my
friends that I can get none of them to move a step at this hour of the
morning, and I have had to come to M. Greig without a second. Had I known
his friend was Captain Thurot I should not have vexed myself. Doubtless M.
Greig has no objection to my entrusting my interests as well as his own in
the hands of M. le Capitaine?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I bowed my assent. Captain Thurot cast a somewhat cold and unsatisfied eye
upon the ruffler, protesting the thing was unusual.
</p>
<p>
Bonnat smiled and shrugged his shoulders, put off his coat with much
deliberation, and took up his place upon the sward, where I soon followed
him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember, it is no fool, this crab,&rdquo; whispered Captain Thurot as he took
my coat from me. &ldquo;And 'tis two to one on him who prefers the parry to the
attack.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I had been reading Molière's &ldquo;Bourgeois Gentilhomme&rdquo; the previous morning,
and as I faced my assailant I had the fencing-master's words as well as
Captain Thurot's running in my ears: &ldquo;To give and not receive is the
secret of the sword.&rdquo; It may appear incredible, but it seemed physically a
trivial affair I was engaged upon until I saw the man Bonnat's eye. He
wore a smile, but his eye had the steely glint of murder! It was as
unmistakable as if his tongue confessed it, and for a second I trembled at
the possibilities of the situation. He looked an unhealthy dog; sallow
exceedingly on the neck, which had the sinews so tight they might have
twanged like wire, and on his cheeks, that he seemed to suck in with a
gluttonous exultation such as a gross man shows in front of a fine meal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you ready, gentlemen?&rdquo; said Thurot; and we nodded. &ldquo;Then in guard!&rdquo;
 said he.
</p>
<p>
We saluted, fell into position and thrust simultaneously in tierce,
parrying alike, then opened more seriously.
</p>
<p>
In Thurot's teaching of me there was one lesson he most unweariedly
insisted on, whose object was to keep my point in a straight line and
parry in the smallest possible circles. I had every mind of it now, but
the cursed thing was that this Bonnat knew it too. He fenced, like an
Italian, wholly from the wrist, and, crouched upon his knees, husbanded
every ounce of energy by the infrequency and the brevity of his thrusts.
His lips drew back from his teeth, giving him a most villainous aspect,
and he began to press in the lower lines.
</p>
<p>
In a side-glance hazarded I saw the anxiety of Thurot's eye and realised
his apprehension. I broke ground, and still, I think, was the bravo's
match but for the alarm of Thurot's eye. It confused me so much that I
parried widely and gave an opening for a thrust that caught me slightly on
the arm, and dyed my shirt-sleeve crimson in a moment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Thurot, and put up his arm.
</p>
<p>
I lowered my weapon, thinking the bout over, and again saw murder in
Bonnat's eye. He lunged furiously at my chest, missing by a miracle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Scélérat!</i>&rdquo; cried Thurot, and, in an uncontrollable fury at the
action, threw himself upon Bonnat and disarmed him.
</p>
<p>
They glared at each other for a minute, and Thurot finally cast the
other's weapon over a hedge. &ldquo;So much for M. Bonnat!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;This is
our valiant gentleman, is it? To stab like an assassin!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Oh, malédiction!</i>&rdquo; said the other, little abashed, and shrugging
his shoulders as he lifted his coat to put it on. &ldquo;Talking of
assassination, I but did the duty of the executioner in his absence, and
proposed to kill the man who meditated the same upon the Prince.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Prince!&rdquo; cried Thurot. &ldquo;Why 'tis the Prince's friend, and saved his
life!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know nothing about that,&rdquo; said Bonnat; &ldquo;but do you think I'd be out
here at such a cursed early hour fencing if any other than M. Albany had
sent me? <i>Pardieu!</i> the whole of you are in the farce, but I always
counted you the Prince's friend, and here you must meddle when I do as I
am told to do!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you tell me, Jean Bonnat, that you take out my friend to murder him
by M. Albany's command?&rdquo; cried Thurot incredulous.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What the devil else?&rdquo; replied the bravo. &ldquo;'Tis true M. Albany only
mentioned that M. des Souliers Rouges was an obstruction in the Rue de la
Boucherie and asked me to clear him out of Dunkerque, but 'twere a tidier
job to clear him altogether. And here is a great pother about an English
hog!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was too busily stanching my wound, that was scarce so serious as it
appeared, to join in this dispute, but the allusion to the Prince and the
Rue de la Boucherie extremely puzzled me. I turned to Bonnat with a cry
for an explanation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;does his Royal Highness claim any prerogative to the Rue
de la Boucherie? I'm unconscious that I ever did either you or him the
smallest harm, and if my service&mdash;innocent enough as it was&mdash;with
the priest Hamilton was something to resent, his Highness has already
condoned the offence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For the sake of my old friend M. le Capitaine here I shall give you one
word of advice,&rdquo; said Bonnat, &ldquo;and that is, to evacuate Dunkerque as
sharply as you may. M. Albany may owe you some obligement, as I've heard
him hint himself, but nevertheless your steps will be safer elsewhere than
in the Rue de la Boucherie.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is far too much of the Rue de la Boucherie about this,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and I hope no insult is intended to certain friends I have or had there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At this they looked at one another. The bravo (for so I think I may at
this time call him) whistled curiously and winked at the other, and, in
spite of himself, Captain Thurot was bound to laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And has M. Paul been haunting the Rue de la Boucherie, too?&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;That, indeed, is to put another face on the business. 'Tis, <i>ma foi!</i>
to expect too much of M. Albany's complaisance. After that there is
nothing for us but to go home. And, harkee! M. Bonnat, no more Venetian
work, or, by St. Denys, I shall throw you into the harbour.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must ever have your joke, my noble M. le Capitaine,&rdquo; said Bonnat
brazenly, and tucked his hat on the side of the head. &ldquo;M. Blanc-bec there
handles <i>arme blanche</i> rather prettily, thanks, no doubt, to the
gallant commander of the <i>Roi Rouge</i>, but if he has a mother let me
suggest the wisdom of his going back to her.&rdquo; And with that and a <i>congé</i>
he left us to enter the <i>auberge</i>.
</p>
<p>
Thurot and I went into the town. He was silent most of the way, ruminating
upon this affair, which it was plain he could unravel better than I could,
yet he refused to give me a hint at the cause of it. I pled with him
vainly for an explanation of the Prince's objection to my person. &ldquo;I
thought he had quite forgiven my innocent part in the Hamilton affair,&rdquo; I
said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so he had,&rdquo; said Thurot. &ldquo;I have his own assurances.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis scarcely like it when he sets a hired assassin on my track to lure
me into a duel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said Thurot, &ldquo;you owe him all&mdash;your escape from
Bicêtre, which could easily have been frustrated; and the very prospect of
the lieutenancy in the Regiment d'Auvergne.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! he has a hand in this?&rdquo; I cried.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;'Tis not the fashion in France to throw unschooled
Scots into such positions out of hand, and only princes may manage it. It
seems, then, that we have our Prince in two moods, which is not uncommon
with the same gentleman. He would favour you for the one reason, and for
the other he would cut your throat. M. Tête-de-fer is my eternal puzzle.
And the deuce is that he has, unless I am much mistaken, the same reason
for favouring and hating you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who, rather?&rdquo; said Thurot, and we were walking down the Rue de la
Boucherie. &ldquo;Why, then, if you must have pointed out to you what is under
your very nose, 'tis the lady who lives here. She is the god from the
machine in half a hundred affairs no less mysterious, and I wish she were
anywhere else than in Dunkerque. But, anyway, she sent you with Hamilton,
and she has secured the favour of the Prince for you, and now&mdash;though
she may not have attempted it&mdash;she has gained you the same person's
enmity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I stopped in the street and turned to him. &ldquo;All this is confused enough to
madden me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and rather than be longer in the mist I shall brave
her displeasure, compel an audience, and ask her for an explanation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Please yourself,&rdquo; said Thurot, and seeing I meant what I said he left me.

CHAPTER XXXIII
</h2>
<h3>
FAREWELL TO MISS WALKINSHAW
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was under the lash of a natural exasperation I went up Mademoiselle's
stairs determined on an interview. Bernard (of all men in the world!)
responded to my knock. I could have thrashed him with a cane if the same
had been handy, but was bound to content myself with the somewhat barren
comfort of affecting that I had never set eyes on him before. He smiled at
first, as if not unpleased to see me, but changed his aspect at the
unresponse of mine.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I desire to see Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
The rogue blandly intimated that she was not at home. There is more truth
in a menial eye than in most others, and this man's fashionable falsehood
extended no further than his lips. I saw quite plainly he was acting upon
instructions, and, what made it the more uncomfortable for him, he saw
that I saw.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well, I shall have the pleasure of waiting in the neighbourhood till
she returns,&rdquo; I said, and leaned against the railing. This frightened him
somewhat, and he hastened to inform me that he did not know when she might
return.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; I said coolly, inwardly pleased to find my courage
much higher in the circumstances than I had expected. &ldquo;If it's midnight
she shall find me here, for I have matters of the first importance upon
which to consult her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He was more disturbed than ever, hummed and hawed and hung upon the
door-handle, making it very plainly manifest that his instructions had not
gone far enough, and that he was unable to make up his mind how he was
further to comport himself to a visitor so persistent. Then, unable to get
a glance of recognition from me, and resenting further the inconvenience
to which I was subjecting him, he rose to an impertinence&mdash;the first
(to do him justice) I had ever found in him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell me who I shall say called?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The thrust was scarcely novel. I took it smiling, and &ldquo;My good rogue,&rdquo;
 said I, &ldquo;if the circumstances were more favourable I should have the
felicity of giving you an honest drubbing.&rdquo; He got very red. &ldquo;Come,
Bernard,&rdquo; I said, adopting another tone, &ldquo;I think you owe me some
consideration. And will you not, in exchange for my readiness to give you
all the information you required some time ago for your employers, tell me
the truth and admit that Mademoiselle is within?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He was saved an answer by the lady herself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;La! Mr. Greig!&rdquo; she cried, coming to the door and putting forth a
welcoming hand. &ldquo;My good Bernard has no discrimination, or he should
except my dear countryman from my general orders against all visitors.&rdquo; So
much in French; and then, as she led the way to her parlour, &ldquo;My dear man
of Mearns, you are as dour as&mdash;as dour as&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As a donkey,&rdquo; I finished, seeing she hesitated for a likeness. &ldquo;And I
feel very much like that humble beast at this moment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not wonder at it,&rdquo; said she, throwing herself in a chair. &ldquo;To thrust
yourself upon a poor lonely woman in this fashion!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am the ass&mdash;I have been the ass&mdash;it would appear, in other
respects as well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She reddened, and tried to conceal her confusion by putting back her hair,
that somehow escaped in a strand about her ears. I had caught her rather
early in the morning; she had not even the preparation of a <i>petit lever</i>;
and because of a certain chagrin at being discovered scarcely looking her
best her first remarks were somewhat chilly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, at least you have persistency, I'll say that of it,&rdquo; she went on,
with a light laugh, and apparently uncomfortable. &ldquo;And for what am I
indebted to so early a visit from my dear countryman?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was partly that I might say a word of thanks personally to you for
your offices in my poor behalf. The affair of the Regiment d'Auvergne is
settled with a suddenness that should be very gratifying to myself, for it
looks as if King Louis could not get on another day wanting my
distinguished services. I am to join the corps at the end of the month,
and must leave Dunkerque forthwith. That being so, it was only proper I
should come in my own person to thank you for your good offices.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do not mention it,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;I am only too glad that I could
be of the smallest service to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot think,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;what I can have done to warrant your
displeasure with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Displeasure!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Who said I was displeased?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What am I to think, then? I have been refused the honour of seeing you
for this past week.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, not displeasure, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; she said, trifling with her rings.
&ldquo;Let us be calling it prudence. I think that might have suggested itself
as a reason to a gentleman of Mr. Greig's ordinary intuitions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a virtue, this prudence, a Greig could never lay claim to,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;And I must tell you that, where the special need for it arises now, and
how it is to be made manifest, is altogether beyond me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said she, and paused. &ldquo;And so you are going to the frontier,
and are come to say good-bye to me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now that you remind me that is exactly my object,&rdquo; I said, rising to go.
She did not have the graciousness even to stay me, but rose too, as if she
felt the interview could not be over a moment too soon. And yet I noticed
a certain softening in her manner that her next words confirmed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so you go, Mr. Greig?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There's but the one thing I would
like to say to my friend, and that's that I should like him not to think
unkindly of one that values his good opinion&mdash;if she were worthy to
have it. The honest and unsuspecting come rarely my way nowadays, and now
that I'm to lose them I feel like to greet.&rdquo; She was indeed inclined to
tears, and her lips were twitching, but I was not enough rid of my
annoyance to be moved much by such a demonstration.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have profited much by your society, Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You
found me a boy, and what way it happens I do not know, but it's a man
that's leaving you. You made my stay here much more pleasant than it would
otherwise have been, and this last kindness&mdash;that forces me away from
you&mdash;is one more I have to thank you for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She was scarcely sure whether to take this as a compliment or the reverse,
and, to tell the truth, I meant it half and half.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I owed all the little I could do to my countryman,&rdquo; said she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I hope I have been useful,&rdquo; I blurted out, determined to show her I
was going with open eyes.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat stricken she put her hand upon my arm. &ldquo;I hope you will forgive
that, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; she said, leaving no doubt that she had jumped to my
meaning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing to forgive,&rdquo; I said shortly. &ldquo;I am proud that I was of
service, not to you alone but to one in the interests of whose house some
more romantical Greigs than I have suffered. My only complaint is that the
person in question seems scarcely to be grateful for the little share I
had unconsciously in preserving his life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am sure he is very grateful,&rdquo; she cried hastily, and perplexed. &ldquo;I may
tell you that he was the means of getting you the post in the regiment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I have been told,&rdquo; I said, and she looked a little startled. &ldquo;So I
have been told. It may be that I'll be more grateful by-and-by, when I see
what sort of a post it is. In the meantime, I have my gratitude greatly
hampered by a kind of inconsistency in the&mdash;in the person's actings
towards myself!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Inconsistency!&rdquo; she repeated bitterly. &ldquo;That need not surprise you! But I
do not understand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is simply that&mdash;perhaps to hasten me to my duties&mdash;his Royal
Highness this morning sent a ruffian to fight me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I have never seen a face so suddenly change as hers did when she heard
this; for ordinary she had a look of considerable amiability, a soft, kind
eye, a ready smile that had the hint (as I have elsewhere said) of
melancholy, a voice that, especially in the Scots, was singularly
attractive. A temper was the last thing I would have charged her with, yet
now she fairly flamed, &ldquo;What is this you are telling me, Paul Greig?&rdquo; she
cried, her eyes stormy, her bosom beginning to heave. &ldquo;Oh, just that M.
Albany (as he calls himself) has some grudge against me, for he sent a man&mdash;Bonnat&mdash;to
pick a quarrel with me, and by Bonnat's own confession the duel that was
to ensue was to be <i>à outrance</i>. But for the intervention of a
friend, half an hour ago, there would have been a vacancy already in the
Regiment d'Auvergne.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You must be mistaken. What object in the wide
world could his Royal Highness have in doing you any harm? You were an
instrument in the preservation of his life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I bowed extremely low, with a touch of the courts I had not when I landed
first in Dunkerque.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have had the distinguished honour, Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And I
should have thought that enough to counterbalance my unfortunate and
ignorant engagement with his enemies.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But why, in Heaven's name, should he have a shred of resentment against
you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that it has something to do with my boldness in using
the Rue de la Boucherie for an occasional promenade.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She put her two hands up to her face for a moment, but I could see the
wine-spill in between, and her very neck was in a flame.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the shame! the shame!&rdquo; she cried, and began to walk up and down the
room like one demented. &ldquo;Am I to suffer these insults for ever in spite of
all that I may do to prove&mdash;to prove&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She pulled herself up short, put down her hands from a face exceedingly
distressed, and looked closely at me. &ldquo;What must you think of me, Mr.
Greig?&rdquo; she asked suddenly in quite a new key.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do I think of myself to so disturb you?&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I do not know
in what way I have vexed you, but to do so was not at all in my intention.
I must tell you that I am not a politician, and that since I came here
these affairs of the Prince and all the rest of it are quite beyond my
understanding. If the cause of the white cockade brought you to France,
Miss Walkinshaw, as seems apparent, I cannot think you are very happy in
it nowadays, but that is no affair of mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She stared at me. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are not mocking me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It would be the last thing I should presume to
do, even if I had a reason. I owe you, after all, nothing but the deepest
gratitude.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beyond the parlour we stood in was a lesser room that was the lady's
boudoir. We stood with our backs to it, and I know not how much of our
conversation had been overheard when I suddenly turned at the sound of a
man's voice, and saw his Royal Highness standing in the door!
</p>
<p>
I could have rubbed my eyes out of sheer incredulity, for that he should
be in that position was as if I had come upon a ghost. He stood with a
face flushed and frowning, rubbing his eyes, and there was something in
his manner that suggested he was not wholly sober.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll be cursed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I haven't been asleep. Deuce take
Clancarty! He kept me at cards till dawn this morning, and I feel as if I
had been all night on heather. <i>Pardieu</i>&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He pulled himself up short and stared, seeing me for the first time. His
face grew purple with annoyance. &ldquo;A thousand pardons!&rdquo; he cried with
sarcasm, and making a deep bow. &ldquo;I was not aware that I intruded on
affairs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Miss Walkinshaw turned to him sharply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no intrusion,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but honesty, in the person of my dear
countryman, who has come to strange quarters with it. Your Royal Highness
has now the opportunity of thanking this gentleman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I' faith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I seem to be kept pretty constantly in mind of the
little I owe to this gentleman in spite of himself. Harkee, my good
Monsieur, I got you a post; I thought you had been out of Dunkerque by
now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The post waits, M. Albany,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I am going to take it up
forthwith. I came here to thank the person to whose kindness I owe the
post, and now I am in a quandary as to whom my thanks should be
addressed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Monsieur, to whom but to your countrywoman? We all of us owe her
everything, and&mdash;egad!&mdash;are not grateful enough,&rdquo; and with that
he looked for the first time at her with his frown gone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;we may put off the compliments till another
occasion. What I must say is that it is a grief and a shame to me that
this gentleman, who has done so much for me&mdash;I speak for myself, your
Royal Highness will observe&mdash;should be so poorly requited.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Requited!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;How now? I trust Monsieur is not dissatisfied.&rdquo; His
face had grown like paste, his hand, that constantly fumbled at his
unshaven chin, was trembling. I felt a mortal pity for this child of
kings, discredited and debauched, and yet I felt bound to express myself
upon the trap that he had laid for me, if Bonnat's words were true.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have said my thanks, M. Albany, very stammeringly for the d'Auvergne
office, because I can only guess at my benefactor. My gratitude&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Tis the scurviest of qualities. A benefactor that does
aught for gratitude had as lief be a selfish scoundrel. We want none of
your gratitude, Monsieur Greig.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis just as well, M. Albany,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;for what there was of it is
mortgaged.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Comment?</i>&rdquo; he asked, uneasily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was challenged to a duel this morning with a man Bonnat that calls
himself your servant,&rdquo; I replied, always very careful to take his own word
for it and assume I spoke to no prince, but simply M. Albany. &ldquo;He informed
me that you had, Monsieur, some objection to my sharing the same street
with you, and had given him his instructions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bonnat,&rdquo; cried the Prince, and rubbed his hand across his temples. &ldquo;I'll
be cursed if I have seen the man for a month. Stay!&mdash;stay&mdash;let
me think! Now that I remember, he met me last night after dinner, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;After dinner! Then surely it should have been in a more favourable mood
to myself, that has done M. Albany no harm,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I do not wonder that
M. Albany has lost so many of his friends if he settles their destinies
after dinner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At first he frowned at this and then he laughed outright.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;here's another Greig to call me gomeral to my
face,&rdquo; and he lounged to a chair where he sunk in inextinguishable
laughter.
</p>
<p>
But if I had brought laughter from him I had precipitated anger elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's a pretty way to speak to his Royal Highness,&rdquo; cried Miss
Walkinshaw, her face like thunder. &ldquo;The manners of the Mearns shine very
poorly here. You forget that you speak to one that is your prince, in
faith your king!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Neither prince nor king of mine, Miss Walkinshaw,&rdquo; I cried, and turned to
go. &ldquo;No, if a hundred thousand swords were at his back. I had once a
notion of a prince that rode along the Gallowgate, but I was then a boy,
and now I am a man&mdash;which you yourself have made me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With that I bowed low and left them. They neither of them said a word. It
was the last I was to see of Clementina Walkinshaw and the last of Charles
Edward.

CHAPTER XXXIV
</h2>
<h3>
OF MY WINTER CAMPAIGN IN PRUSSIA, AND ANOTHER MEETING WITH MACKELLAR OF
KILBRIDE
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> have no intention here of narrating at large what happened in my short
career as a soldier of the French Army, curious though some of the things
that befell me chanced to be. They may stand for another occasion, while I
hurriedly and briefly chronicle what led to my second meeting with
MacKellar of Kilbride, and through that same to the restoration of the
company of Father Hamilton, the sometime priest of Dixmunde.
</p>
<p>
The Regiment d'Auvergne was far from its native hills when first I joined
it, being indeed on the frontier of Austria. 'Twas a corps not long
embodied, composed of a preposterous number of mere lads as soft as kail,
yet driven to miracles of exertion by drafted veteran officers of other
regiments who stiffened their command with the flat of the sword. As for
my lieutenancy it was nothing to be proud of in such a battalion, for I
herded in a mess of foul-mouthed scoundrels and learned little of the
trade of soldiering that I was supposed to be taught in the interval
between our departure from the frontier and our engagement on the field as
allies with the Austrians. Of the Scots that had been in the regiment at
one time there was only one left&mdash;a major named MacKay, that came
somewhere out of the Reay country in the shire of Sutherland, and was
reputed the drunkenest officer among the allies, yet comported himself, on
the strength of his Hielan' extraction, towards myself, his Lowland
countryman, with such a ludicrous haughtiness I could not bear the man&mdash;no,
not from the first moment I set eyes on him!
</p>
<p>
He was a pompous little person with legs bowed through years of riding
horse, and naturally he was the first of my new comrades I introduced
myself to when I joined the colours. I mind he sat upon a keg of bullets,
looking like a vision of Bacchus, somewhat soiled and pimply, when I
entered to him and addressed him, with a certain gladness, in our tongue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; was what he said. &ldquo;Another of his Royal Highness's Sassenach
friends! Here's a wheen of the lousiest French privates ever shook in
their breeks in front of a cannon, wanting smeddum and courage drummed
into them with a scabbard, and they send me Sassenachs to do the business
with when the whole hearty North of Scotland is crawling with the stuff I
want particularly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anyway, here I am, major,&rdquo; said I, slightly taken aback at this, &ldquo;and
you'll have to make the best of me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; cried he vulgarly and cracked his thumb. &ldquo;I have small stomach
for his Royal Highness's recommendations; I have found in the past that he
sends to Austria&mdash;him and his friends&mdash;only the stuff he has no
use for nearer the English Channel, where it's I would like to be this
day. They're talking of an invasion, I hear; wouldn't I like to be among
the first to have a slap again at Geordie?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
My birse rose at this, which I regarded as a rank treason in any man that
spoke my own language even with a tartan accent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A slap at Geordie!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You made a bonny-like job o't when you had
the chance!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was my first and last confabulation of a private nature with Major
Dugald MacKay. Thereafter he seldom looked the road I was on beyond to
give an order or pick a fault, and, luckily, though a pleasant footing
with my neighbours has ever been my one desire in life, I was not much put
up or down by the ill-will of such a creature.
</p>
<p>
Like a break in a dream, a space of all unfriended travelling, which is
the worst travelling of all, appears my time of marching with the Regiment
d'Auvergne. I was lost among aliens&mdash;aliens in tongue and sentiment,
and engaged, to tell the truth, upon an enterprise that never enlisted the
faintest of my sympathy. All I wished was to forget the past (and that, be
sure, was the one impossible thing), and make a living of some sort. The
latter could not well be more scanty, for my pay was a beggar's, and
infrequent at that, and finally it wholly ceased.
</p>
<p>
I saw the world, so much of it as lies in Prussia, and may be witnessed
from the ranks of a marching regiment of the line; I saw life&mdash;the
life of the tent and the bivouac, and the unforgettable thing of it was
death&mdash;death in the stricken field among the grinding hoofs of
horses, below the flying wheels of the artillery.
</p>
<p>
And yet if I had had love there&mdash;some friend to talk to when the
splendour of things filled me; the consciousness of a kind eye to share
the pleasure of a sunshine or to light at a common memory; or if I had had
hope, the prospect of brighter days and a restitution of my self-respect,
they might have been much happier these marching days that I am now only
too willing to forget. For we trod in many pleasant places even when
weary, by summer fields jocund with flowers, and by autumn's laden
orchards. Stars shone on our wearied columns as we rested in the meadows
or on the verge of woods, half satisfied with a gangrel's supper and
sometimes joining in a song. I used to feel then that here was a better
society after all than some I had of late been habituated with upon the
coast. And there were towns we passed through: 'twas sweet exceedingly to
hear the echo of our own loud drums, the tarantara of trumpets. I liked to
see the folks come out although they scarce were friendly, and feel that
priceless zest that is the guerdon of the corps, the crowd, the mob&mdash;that
I was something in a vastly moving thing even if it was no more than the
regiment of raw lads called d'Auvergne.
</p>
<p>
We were, for long in our progress, no part of the main army, some strategy
of which we could not guess the reasoning, making it necessary that we
should move alone through the country; and to the interest of our progress
through these foreign scenes was added the ofttimes apprehension that we
might some day suffer an alarm from the regiments of the great Frederick.
Twice we were surprised by night and our pickets broken in, once a native
guided us to a <i>guet-apens</i>&mdash;an ambuscade&mdash;where, to do him
justice, the major fought like a lion, and by his spirit released his
corps from the utmost danger. A war is like a harvest; you cannot aye be
leading in, though the common notion is that in a campaign men are
fighting even-on. In the cornfield the work depends upon the weather; in
the field of war (at least with us 'twas so) the actual strife must often
depend upon the enemy, and for weeks on end we saw them neither tail nor
horn, as the saying goes. Sometimes it seemed as if the war had quite
forgotten us, and was waging somewhere else upon the planet far away from
Prussia.
</p>
<p>
We got one good from the marching and the waiting; it put vigour in our
men. Day by day they seemed to swell and strengthen, thin faces grew
well-filled and ruddy, slouching steps grew confident and firm. And thus
the Regiment d'Au-vergne was not so badly figured when we fought the fight
of Rosbach that ended my career of glory.
</p>
<p>
Rosbach!&mdash;its name to me can still create a tremor. We fought it in
November month in a storm of driving snow. Our corps lay out upon the
right of Frederick among fields that were new-ploughed for wheat and
broken up by ditches. The d'Auvergnes charged with all the fire of
veterans; they were smashed by horse, but rose and fell and rose again
though death swept across them like breath from a furnace, scorching and
shrivelling all before it. The Prussian and the Austrian guns went
rat-a-pat like some gigantic drum upon the braes, and nearer the musketry
volleys mingled with the plunge of horse and shouting of commanders so
that each sound individually was indistinguishable, but all was blended in
one unceasing melancholy hum.
</p>
<p>
That drumming on the braes and that long melancholy hum are what most
vividly remains to me of Rosbach, for I fell early in the engagement,
struck in the charge by the sabre of a Prussian horseman that cleft me to
the skull in a slanting stroke and left me incapable, but not unconscious,
on the field.
</p>
<p>
I lay for hours with other wounded in the snow The battle changed ground;
the noises came from the distance: we seemed to be forgotten. I pitied
myself exceedingly. Finally I swounded.
</p>
<p>
When I came to myself it was night and men with lanterns were moving about
the fields gathering us in like blackcock where we lay. Two Frenchmen came
up and spoke to me, but what they said was all beyond me for I had clean
forgotten every word of their language though that morning I had known it
scarcely less fully than my own. I tried to speak in French, it seems, and
thought I did so, but in spite of me the words were the broadest lallands
Scots such as I had not used since I had run, a bare-legged boy, about the
braes of, home. And otherwise my faculties were singularly acute, for I
remember how keenly I noticed the pitying eye of the younger of the two
men.
</p>
<p>
What they did was to stanch my wound and go away. I feared I was deserted,
but by-and-by they returned with another man who held the lantern close to
my face as he knelt beside me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the black stones of Baillinish!&rdquo; said he in an unmistakable Hielan'
accent, &ldquo;and what have I here the night but the boy that harmed the bylie?
You were not in your mother's bosom when you got that stroke!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I saw his smile in the light of his lanthom, 'twas no other than MacKellar
of Kilbride!
</p>
<p>
He was a surgeon in one of the corps; had been busy at his trade in
another part of the field when the two Frenchmen who had recognised me for
a Scot had called him away to look to a compatriot.
</p>
<p>
Under charge of Kilbride (as, in our country fashion, I called him) I was
taken in a waggon with several other wounded soldiers over the frontier
into Holland, that was, perhaps, the one unvexed part of all the Continent
of Europe in these stirring days.
</p>
<p>
I mended rapidly, and cheery enough were these days of travel in a cart,
so cheery that I never considered what the end of them might be, but was
content to sit in the sunshine blithely conversing with this odd surgeon
of the French army who had been roving the world for twenty years like my
own Uncle Andrew, and had seen service in every army in Europe, but yet
hankered to get back to the glens of his nativity, where he hoped his
connection with the affair of Tearlach and the Forty-five would be
forgotten.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's just this way of it, Hazel Den,&rdquo; he would say to me, &ldquo;there's them
that has got enough out of Tearlach to make it worth their while to stick
by him and them that has not. I am of the latter. I have been hanging
about Paris yonder for a twelvemonth on the promise of the body that I
should have a post that suited with my talents, and what does he do but
get me clapped into a scurvy regiment that goes trudging through Silesia
since Whitsunday, with never a sign of the paymaster except the once and
then no more than a tenth of what was due to me. It is, maybe, glory, as
the other man said; but my sorrow, it is not the kind that makes a
clinking in your pouches.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He had a comfortable deal of money to have so poor an account of his
paymaster, and at that I hinted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Allow me for that!&rdquo; he cried with great amusement at my wonder. &ldquo;Fast
hand at a feast and fast feet at a foray is what the other man said, and
I'm thinking it is a very good observation, too. Where would I be if I was
lippening on the paymaster?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Man! you surely have not been stealing?&rdquo; said I, with such great
innocency that he laughed like to end.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stealing!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It's no theft to lift a purse in an enemy's
country.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But these were no enemies of yours?&rdquo; I protested, &ldquo;though you happen to
be doctoring in their midst.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tuts! tuts, man!&rdquo; said he shortly. &ldquo;When the conies quarrel the quirky
one (and that's Sir Fox if ye like to ken) will get his own. There seems
far too much delicacy about you, my friend, to be a sporran-soldier
fighting for the best terms an army will give you. And what for need you
grumble at my having found a purse in an empty house when it's by virtue
of the same we're at this moment making our way to the sea?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I could make no answer to that, for indeed I had had, like the other three
wounded men in the cart with me, the full benefit of his purse, wherever
he had found it, and but for that we had doubtless been mouldering in a
Prussian prison.
</p>
<p>
It will be observed that MacKellar spoke of our making for the sea, and
here it behoves that I should tell how that project arose.
</p>
<p>
When we had crossed the frontier the first time it was simply because it
seemed the easiest way out of trouble, though it led us away from the
remnants of the army. I had commented upon this the first night we stopped
within the Netherlands, and the surgeon bluntly gave me his mind on the
matter. The truth was, he said, that he was sick of his post and meant to
make this the opportunity of getting quit of it.
</p>
<p>
I went as close as I dared upon a hint that the thing looked woundily like
a desertion. He picked me up quick enough and counselled me to follow his
example, and say farewell to so scurvy a service as that I had embarked
on. His advices might have weighed less with me (though in truth I was
sick enough of the Regiment d'Auvergne and a succession of defeats) if he
had not told me that there was a certain man at Helvoetsluys he knew I
should like to see.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who might that be?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who but his reverence himself?&rdquo; said Kilbride, who dearly loved an
effect. &ldquo;Yon night I met you in the Paris change-house it was planned by
them I was with, one of them being Buhot himself of the police, that the
old man must be driven out of his nest in the Hôtel Dieu, seeing they had
got all the information they wanted from him, and I was one of the parties
who was to carry this into effect. At the time I fancied Buhot was as keen
upon yourself as upon the priest, and I thought I was doing a wonderfully
clever thing to spy your red shoes and give you a warning to quit the
priest, but all the time Buhot was only laughing at me, and saw you and
recognised you himself in the change-house. Well, to make the long tale
short, when we went to the hospital the birds were both of them gone,
which was more than we bargained for, because some sort of trial was due
to the priest though there was no great feeling against him. Where he had
taken wing to we could not guess, but you will not hinder him to come on a
night of nights (as we say) to the lodging I was tenanting at the time in
the Rue Espade, and throw himself upon my mercy. The muckle hash! I'll
allow the insolency of the thing tickled me greatly. The man was a fair
object, too; had not tasted food for two days, and captured my fancy by a
tale I suppose there is no trusting, that he had given you the last few <i>livres</i>
he had in the world.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That was true enough about the <i>livres</i>,&rdquo; I said with gratitude.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was it, faith?&rdquo; cried Kilbride. &ldquo;Then I'm glad I did him the little
service that lay in my power, which was to give him enough money to pay
for posting to Helvoetsluys, where he is now, and grateful enough so far
as I could gather from the last letters I had from him, and also mighty
anxious to learn what became of his secretary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would give the last plack in my pocket to see the creature,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you indeed?&rdquo; said Kilbride. &ldquo;Then here's the road for you, and it
must be a long furlough whatever of it from the brigade of Marshal
Clermont.&rdquo;
 </p>

CHAPTER XXXV
</h2>
<h3>
BRINGS ME TO HELVOETSLUYS IN WINTER WEATHER
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>ilbride and I parted company with the others once we had got within the
lines of Holland; the cateran (as I would sometimes be calling him in a
joke) giving them as much money as might take them leisuredly to the south
they meant to make for, and he and I proceeded on our way across the
country towards the mouth of the River Maas.
</p>
<p>
It was never my lot before nor since to travel with a more cheerful
companion. Not the priest himself had greater humour in his composition,
and what was more it was a jollity I was able the better to understand,
for while much of Hamilton's <i>esprit</i> missed the spark with me
because it had a foreign savour, the pawkiness of Kilbride was just the
marrow of that I had seen in folks at home. And still the man was strange,
for often he had melancholies. Put him in a day of rain and wind and you
would hear him singing like a laverock the daftest songs in Erse; or give
him a tickle task at haggling in the language of signs with a
broad-bottomed bargeman, or the driver of a rattel-van, and the fun would
froth in him like froth on boiling milk.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, and I should say like cream, for this Mac-Kellar man had, what is
common enough among the clans in spite of our miscalling, a heart of jeel
for the tender moment and a heart of iron for the hard. But black, black,
were his vapours when the sun shone, which is surely the poorest of
excuses for dolours. I think he hated the flatness of the land we
travelled in. To me it was none amiss, for though it was winter I could
fancy how rich would be the grass of July in the polders compared with our
poor stunted crops at home, and that has ever a cheerful influence on any
man that has been bred in Lowland fields. But he (if I did not misread his
eye) looked all ungratefully on the stretching leagues that ever opened
before us as we sailed on waterways or jolted on the roads.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not ken how it may be with you, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; he said one day as,
somewhere in Brabant, our sluggish vessel opened up a view of canal that
seemed to stretch so far it pricked the eye of the setting sun, and the
windmills whirled on either hand ridiculous like the games of children&mdash;&ldquo;I
do not ken how it may be with you, but I'm sick of this country. It's no
better nor a bannock, and me so fond of Badenoch!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed and there's a sameness about every part of it,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;and
yet it has its qualities. See the sun on yonder island&mdash;'tis pleasant
enough to my notion, and as for the folk, they are not the cut of our own,
but still they have very much in common with folks I've seen in Ayr.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He frowned at that unbelievingly, and cast a sour eye upon some women that
stood upon a bridge. &ldquo;Troth!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you would not compare these
limmers with our own. I have not seen a light foot and a right dark eye
since ever I put the back of me to the town of Inverness in the year of
'Fifty-six.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor I since I left the Mearns,&rdquo; I cried, suddenly thinking of Isobel and
forgetting all that lay between that lass and me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; cried Kilbride. &ldquo;And that's the way of it? Therms more than
Clemie Walkinshaw, is there? I was ill to convince that a nephew of Andy
Greig's began the game at the age of twenty-odd with a lady that might
have been his mother.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I felt very much ashamed that he should have any knowledge of this part of
my history, and seeing it he took to bantering me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must save my reputation with myself for
penetration, for I aye argued with Buhot that your tanglement with madame
was something short of innocency for all your mim look, and he was for
swearing the lady had found a fool.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am beat to understand how my affairs came to be the topic of dispute
with you and Buhot?&rdquo; said I, astonished.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what for no'?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Wasn't the man's business to find out
things, and would you have me with no interest in a ploy when it turned
up? There were but the two ways of it&mdash;you were all the gomeral in
love that Buhot thought you, or you were Andy Greig's nephew and willing
to win the woman's favour (for all her antiquity) by keeping Buhot in the
news of Hamilton's movements.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;that was a horrible alternative!&rdquo; even then failing
to grasp all that he implied.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he said pawkily; &ldquo;but you cannot deny you kept them very well
informed upon your master's movements, otherwise it had gone very hard
perhaps with his Royal Highness.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I would have as soon informed upon my father. And who was
there to inform?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kilbride looked at me curiously as if he half doubted my innocence. &ldquo;It is
seldom I have found the man Buhot in a lie of the sort,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but he
led me to understand that what information he had of the movements of the
priest came from yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I jumped to my feet, and almost choked in denying it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very well, very well!&rdquo; said Kilbride coolly. &ldquo;There is no need to
make a <i>fracas</i> about the matter. I am just telling you what Buhot
told me. And troth! it was a circumstantial story he had of it; for he
said that the Marshal Duke de Bellisle, and Monsieur Florentin, and
Monsieur Berrier, and all the others of the Cabinet, had Fleuriau's name
and direction from yourself, and found the plot had some connection with
the affair of Damiens. George Kelly, the Prince's secretary, was another
man that told me.&rdquo; He gazed along the deck of the scow we sat in, as if
thinking hard, and then turned to me with a hesitating suggestion.
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are forgetting. Perhaps you wrote the woman and
told her innocently enough, and that would come to the same thing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was overwhelmed with confusion at the idea, though the possibility of my
letters being used had once before occurred to me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you must know, it is true I wrote some letters to Miss
Walkinshaw,&rdquo; I confessed shamefacedly. &ldquo;But they were very carefully
transmitted by Bernard the Swiss to her, for I got her answers back.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;For simplicity you beat all!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;You sent your news through the
Swiss, that was in Buhot's pay, and took the charge from Hamilton's
pistols, and did his part in helping you to escape from jyle with a great
degree of humour as those of us who knew what was afoot had to agree, and
you think the man would swither about peeping into a letter you entrusted
to him, particularly if it was directed to hersel'! The sleep-bag was
under your head sure enough, as the other man said.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I was the unconscious wretch that betrayed our hiding in the Hôtel
Dieu!&rdquo; I cried with much chagrin, seeing at a flash what all this meant.
&ldquo;If I had Bernard here I could thraw his neck.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and what for should it be Bernard? The man but did
what he was told, and there, by my troth! when I think of it, I'm no' so
sure that he was any different from yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, just that hersel' told you to keep her informed of your movements and
you did so. In Bernard and you she had a pair of spies instead of only the
one had she trusted in either.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what in all the world would she be doing that for?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What but for her lover the prince?&rdquo; said he with a sickening promptness
that some way left me without a doubt he spoke with knowledge. &ldquo;Foul fa'
the day he ever clapt eyes on her! for she has the cunning of the fox,
though by all accounts a pleasant person. They say she has a sister that's
in the service of the queen at St. James's, and who kens but for all her
pretended affection for Tearlach she may be playing all the time into the
hands of his enemies? She made you and this Bernard the means of putting
an end to the Jesuit plot upon his Royal Highness by discovering the
source of it, and now the Jesuits, as I'm told, are to be driven furth the
country and putten to the horn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was stunned by this revelation of what a tool I had been in the hands of
one I fancied briefly that I was in love with. For long I sat silent
pondering on it, and at last unable to make up my mind whether I should
laugh or swear. Kilbride, while affecting to pay no heed to me, was keen
enough to see my perturbation, and had, I think, a sort of pride that he
had been able to display such an astuteness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm afraid,&rdquo; said I at last, &ldquo;there is too much probability in all that
you have said and thought. I am a stupendous ass, Mr. MacKellar, and you
are a very clever man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not at all, not at all!&rdquo; he protested hurriedly. &ldquo;I have just some
natural Hielan' interest in affairs of intrigue, and you have not (by your
leave) had my advantages of the world, for I have seen much of the evil as
well as the good of it, and never saw a woman's hand in aught yet but I
wondered what mischief she was planning. There's much, I'm telling you, to
be learned about a place like Fontainebleau or Versailles, and I
advantaged myself so well of my opportunities there that you could not
drive a hole but I would put a nail in it, as the other man said.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my hope is that I may never meet the woman again, and
that's without a single angry feeling to her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You need not fear about that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The thing that does not lie in
your road will never break your leg, as the other man said, and I'll be
surprised if she puts herself in your way again now that her need for you
is done. A score of your friends in Dunkerque could have told you that she
was daft about him. I might be vexed for you if I did not know from your
own mouth of the other one in Mearns.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We'll say nothing about that,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;for that's a tale that's by wi'.
She's lost to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He gave a little chuckle and had that turn in the eye that showed he had a
curious thought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Oh, just an old word we have in the
Language, that with a two-deer stag-hound it will be happening often that
a stag's amissing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's another thing I would like you to tell me out of your
experience,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and that is the reason for the Prince's doing me a
good turn with the one hand and a bad one with the other; using his
efforts to get me the lieutenancy and at the same time putting a man on my
track to quarrel with me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's as plain as the nose on your face,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It was no great
situation he got you when it was in the Regiment d'Auvergne, as you have
discovered, but it would be got I'll warrant on the pressure of the
Walkinshaw one. Just because she had that interest in you to press him for
the post, and you were in the trim to keep up a correspondence with her
(though in his own interest, as he must know, so far as she was
concerned), he would want you out of the road. Love is like lairdship,
Hazel Den, and it puts up very poorly with fellowship, as the other man
said.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I thought of the occasions when his Royal Highness had seen me at night in
front of a certain window in the Rue de la Boucherie, and concluded that
Kilbride in this too had probably hit the mark.
</p>
<p>
And so we passed through Holland in many changes of weather that finally
turned to a black frost, which covered the canals with ice whereon skated
the Dutch folks very pleasantly, but we were the losers, as the rest of
our journey had to be made by post.
</p>
<p>
It was well on in the winter when we got to Helvoetsluys.

CHAPTER XXXVI
</h2>
<h3>
FATHER HAMILTON IS THREATENED BY THE JESUITS AND WE ARE FORCED TO FLY
AGAIN
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he priest, poor man! aged a dozen years by his anxieties since I had seen
him last, was dubious of his senses when I entered where he lodged, and he
wept like a bairn to see my face again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Scotland! Scotland! beshrew me, child, and I'd liefer have this than ten
good dinners at Verray's!&rdquo; cried he, and put his arms about my shoulders
and buried his face in my waistcoat to hide his uncontrollable tears.
</p>
<p>
He was quartered upon a pilot of the Schelde and Hollands Deep, whose only
child he made a shift to tutor in part payment of his costs, and the very
moment that we had come in upon him he was full of a matter that had
puzzled him for weeks before we came to Helvoetsluys. 'Twas a thing that
partly hurt his pride, though that may seem incredible, and partly gave
him pleasure, and 'twas merely that when he had at last found his
concealment day and night in the pilot's house unendurable, and ventured a
stroll or two upon the dunes in broad sunshine, no one paid any attention
to him. There were soldiers and sailors that must have some suspicions of
his identity, and he had himself read his own story and description in one
of the gazettes, yet never a hand was raised to capture him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> Paul,&rdquo; he cried to me in a perplexity. &ldquo;I am the most
marvellous priest unfrocked, invisible to the world as if I had Mambrino's
helmet. Sure it cannot be that I am too stale quarry for their hunting! My
<i>amour propre</i> baulks at such conclusion. I that have&mdash;heaven
help me!&mdash;loaded pistols against the Lord's anointed, might as well
have gone shooting sparrows for all the infamy it has gained me. But
yesterday I passed an officer of the peace that cried '<i>Bon jour</i>,
father,' in villainous French with a smile so sly I could swear he knew my
history from the first breeching. I avow that my hair stirred under my hat
when he said it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
MacKellar stood by contemptuous of the priest's raptures over his restored
secretary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Goodness be about us!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a pity the brock should be hiding
when there's nobody hunting him! The first squirt of the haggis is always
the hottest, as the other man said. If they were keen on your track at the
start of it&mdash;and it's myself has the doubt of that same&mdash;you may
warrant they are slack on it now. It's Buhot himself would be greatly put
about if you went to the jail and put out your hands for the manacles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Father Hamilton looked bewildered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Expiscate, good Monsieur MacKellar,&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kilbride just means,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you are in the same case as myself,
and that orders have gone out that no one is to trouble you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He believed it, and still he was less cheerful than I looked for. &ldquo;Indeed,
'tis like enough,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I have put my fat on a trap for a fortnight
back to catch my captors and never a rat of them will come near me, but
pass with sniffing noses. And yet on my word I have little to rejoice for.
My friends have changed coats with my enemies because they swear I
betrayed poor Fleuriau. I'd sooner die on the rack&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Father Hamilton!&rdquo; I could not help crying, with remorse upon my
countenance. He must have read the story in a single glance at me, for he
stammered and took my hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! there too, Scotland!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I forswear the company of innocence
after this. No matter, 'tis never again old Dixmunde parish for poor
Father Hamilton that loved his flock well enough and believed the best of
everybody and hated the confessional because it made the world so wicked.
My honey-bees will hum next summer among another's flowers, and my darling
blackbirds will be all starving in this pestilent winter weather. Paul,
Paul, hear an old man's wisdom&mdash;be frugal in food, and raiment, and
pleasure, and let thy ambitions flutter, but never fly too high to come
down at a whistle. But here am I, old Pater Dull, prating on foolish
little affairs, and thou and our honest friend here new back from the
sounding of the guns. Art a brave fighter, lad? I heard of thee in the
grenadier company of d'Auvergne.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We did the best part of our fighting with our shanks, as the other man
said,&rdquo; cried Kilbride. &ldquo;But Mr. Greig came by a clout that affected his
mind and made him clean forget the number of his regiment, and that is
what for the lowlands of Holland is a very pleasant country just now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wounded!&rdquo; cried the priest, disturbed at this intelligence. &ldquo;Had I known
on't I should have prayed for thy deliverance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have little doubt he did that for himself,&rdquo; said Kilbride. &ldquo;When I came
on him after Rosbach he was behind a dyke, that is not a bad alternative
for prayer when the lead is in the air.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We made up our minds to remain for a while at Helvoet, but we had not
determined what our next step should be, when in came the priest one day
with his face like clay and his limbs trembling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Paul!&rdquo; he cried, and fell into a chair; &ldquo;here's Nemesis, daughter of
Nox, a scurvy Italian, and wears a monkish cowl. I fancied it were too
good to be true that I should be free from further trials.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Surely Buhot has not taken it into his head to move again,&rdquo; I cried.
&ldquo;That would be very hirpling justice after so long an interval. And in any
case they could scarcely hale you out of the Netherlands.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, lad, not Buhot,&rdquo; said he, perspiring with his apprehensions, &ldquo;but the
Society. There's one Gordoletti, a pretended Lutheran that hails from
Jena, that has been agent between the Society and myself before now, and
when I was out there he followed me upon the street with the eyes of a
viper. I'll swear the fellow has a poignard and means the letting of
blood. I know how 'twill be&mdash;a watch set upon this building,
Gordoletti upon the steps some evening; a jostle, a thrust, and a speeding
shade. A right stout shade too! if spirits are in any relation of measure
to the corporeal clay. Oh, lad, what do I say? my sinner's wit must be
evincing in the front of doom itself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I thought he simply havered, but found there was too real cause for his
distress. That afternoon the monk walked up and down the street without
letting his eyes lose a moment's sight of the entrance to the pilot's
house where Father Hamilton abode. I could watch him all the better
because I shared a room with Kilbride on the same side of the street, and
even to me there was something eerie in the sight of this long thin
stooping figure in its monkish garment, slouching on the stones or hanging
over the parapet of the bridge, his eyes, lambent black and darting, over
his narrow chafts. Perhaps it was but fancy, yet I thought I saw in the
side of his gown the unmistakable bulge of a dagger. He paced the street
for hours or leaned over the parapet affecting an interest in the barges,
and all the time the priest sat fascinated within, counting his sentence
come.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, by my faith and it is not so bad as that,&rdquo; I protested on returning
to find him in this piteous condition. &ldquo;Surely there are two swords here
that at the worst of it can be depended on to protect you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He shook his head dolefully. &ldquo;It is no use, Paul,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The poignard
or the phial&mdash;'tis all the same to them or Gordoletti, and hereafter
I dare not touch a drop of wine or indulge in a meagre soup.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there may be a mistake, and this Gordoletti may
have nothing to do with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man wears a cowl&mdash;a monkish cowl&mdash;and that is enough for
me. A Jesuit out of his customary <i>soutane</i> is like the devil in
dancing shoes&mdash;be sure his lordship means mischief. Oh! Paul, I would
I were back in Bicêtre and like to die there cleaner than on the banks of
a Dutch canal. I protest I hate to think of dying by a canal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Still I was incredulous that harm was meant to him, and he proceeded to
tell me the Society of Jesus was upon the brink of dissolution, and
desperate accordingly. The discovery of Fleuriau's plot against the Prince
had determined the authorities upon the demolition and extinction of the
Jesuits throughout the whole of the King's dominion. Their riches and
effects and churches were to be seized to the profit and emolument of the
Crown; the reverend Fathers were to be banished furth of France for ever.
Designs so formidable had to be conducted cautiously, and so far the only
evidence of a scheme against the Society was to be seen in the Court
itself, where the number of priests of the order was being rapidly
diminished.
</p>
<p>
I thought no step of the civil power too harsh against the band of whom
the stalking man in the cowl outside was representative, and indeed the
priest at last half-infected myself with his terrors. We sat well back
from the window looking out upon the street till it was dusk. There was
never a moment when the assassin (as I still must think him) was not
there, his interest solely in the house we sat in. And when it was wholly
dark, and a single lamp of oil swinging on a cord across the thoroughfare
lit the passage of the few pedestrians that went along the street,
Gordoletti was still close beneath it, silent, meditating, and alert.
</p>
<p>
MacKellar came in from his coffee-house. We sat in darkness, except for
the flicker of a fire of peat. He must have thought the spectacle curious.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;candles must be unco dear in this shire when the
pair of you cannot afford one between you to see each other yawning. I'm
of a family myself that must be burning a dozen at a time and at both ends
to make matters cheery, for it's a gey glum world at the best of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He stumbled over to the mantel-shelf where there was customarily a candle;
found and lit it, and held it up to see if there was any visible reason
for our silence.
</p>
<p>
The priest's woebegone countenance set him into a shout of laughter. His
amusement scarcely lessened when he heard of the ominous gentleman in the
cowl.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo; he said, and speedily devised a plan to test the occasion of
Father Hamilton's terrors. He arranged that he should dress himself in the
priest's garments, and as well as no inconsiderable difference in their
bulk might let him, simulate the priest by lolling into the street.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A brave plan verily,&rdquo; quo' the priest, &ldquo;but am I a bowelless rogue to let
another have my own particular poignard? No, no, Messieurs, let me pay for
my own <i>pots cassés</i> and run my own risks in my own <i>soutane</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With that he rose to his feet and was bold enough to offer a trial that
was attended by considerable hazard.
</p>
<p>
It was determined, however, that I should follow close upon the heels of
Kilbride in his disguise, prepared to help him in the case of too serious
a surprise.
</p>
<p>
The night was still. There were few people in the street, which was one of
several that led down to the quays. The sky had but a few wan stars. When
MacKellar stepped forth in the priest's hat and cloak, he walked slowly
towards the harbour, ludicrously imitating the rolling gait of his
reverence, while I stayed for a little in the shelter of the door.
Gordoletti left his post upon the bridge and stealthily followed Kilbride.
I gave him some yards of law and followed Gordoletti.
</p>
<p>
Our footsteps sounded on the stones; 'twas all that broke the evening
stillness except the song of a roysterer who staggered upon the quays. The
moment was fateful in its way and yet it ended farcically, for ere he had
gained the foot of the street Kilbride turned and walked back to meet the
man that stalked him. We closed upon the Italian to find him baffled and
confused.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take that for your attentions!&rdquo; cried Kilbride, and buffeted the fellow
on the ear, a blow so secular and telling from a man in a frock that
Gordoletti must have thought himself bewitched, for he gave a howl and
took to his heels. Kilbride attempted to stop him, but the cassock escaped
his hands and his own unwonted costume made a chase hopeless. As for me, I
was content to let matters remain as they were now that Father Hamilton's
suspicions seemed too well founded.
</p>
<p>
It did not surprise me that on learning of our experience the priest
should determine on an immediate departure from Helvoetsluys. But where he
was to go was more than he could readily decide. He proposed and rejected
a score of places&mdash;Bordeaux, Flanders, the Hague, Katwyk farther up
the coast, and many others&mdash;weighing the advantages of each,
enumerating his acquaintances in each, discovering on further thought that
each and every one of them had some feature unfavourable to his
concealment from the Jesuits.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You would be as long tuning your pipes as another would be playing a
tune,&rdquo; said Kilbride at last. &ldquo;There's one thing sure of it, that you
cannot be going anywhere the now without Mr. Greig and myself, and what
ails you at Dunkerque in which we have all of us acquaintances?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A season ago the suggestion would have set my heart in flame; but now it
left me cold. Yet I backed up the proposal, for I reflected that (keeping
away from the Rue de la Boucherie) we might there be among a good many
friends. Nor was his reverence ill to influence in favour of the proposal.
</p>
<p>
The next morning saw us, then, upon a hoy that sailed for Calais and was
bargained to drop us at Dunkerque.

CHAPTER XXXVII
</h2>
<h3>
I OVERHEAR THE PLAN OF BRITAIN'S INVASION
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> began these chronicles with a homily upon the pregnancy of chance that
gives the simplest of our acts ofttimes far-reaching and appalling
consequences. It is clear that I had never become the Spoiled Horn and
vexed my parents' lives had not a widow woman burned her batch of scones,
and though perhaps the pair of shoes in the chest bequeathed to me by my
Uncle Andrew were without the magic influence he and I gave credit for, it
is probable that I had made a different flight from Scotland had they not
led me in the way of Daniel Risk.
</p>
<p>
And even now their influence was not ended. During the months I had spent
at soldiering the red shoes reposed among my baggage; even when I had
changed from the uniform of the Regiment d'Auvergne upon the frontier of
Holland, and made myself again a common citizen of Europe, I had some
freit (as we say of a superstition) against resuming the shoes that had
led me previously into divers perils. But the day we left Helvoet in the
Hollands Deep hoy, I was so hurried in my departure that the red shoes
were the only ones I could lay hands on. As luck would have it, when I
entered Dunkerque for the last time in my history some days after, I was
wearing the same leather as on the first day of my arrival there, and the
fact led, by a singularity of circumstances, to my final severance from
many of those: companions&mdash;some of them pleasant and unforgetable&mdash;I
had made acquaintance with in France.
</p>
<p>
It was thus that the thing happened.
</p>
<p>
When we entered Dunkerque, the priest, Kilbride, and I went to an inn upon
the sea front. Having breakfasted I was deputed to go forth and call upon
Thurot, explain our circumstances, take his counsel, and return to the hoy
where my two friends would return to wait for me. He was out when I
reached his lodging, but his Swiss&mdash;a different one from what he had
before when I was there&mdash;informed me that his master was expected
back at any moment, and invited me to step in and wait for him. I availed
myself of the opportunity.
</p>
<p>
Our voyage along the coast had been delayed by contrary winds, so that now
it was the Sabbath; the town was by-ordinary still (though indeed Sabbath
nor Saturday made much difference, as a rule, on the gaiety of Dunkerque),
and wearied by the sea travel that had just concluded I fell fast asleep
in Captain Thurot's chair.
</p>
<p>
I was wakened by a loud knocking at the outer door, not the first, as it
may be remembered, that called me forth from dreams to new twists of
fortune, and I started to my feet to meet my host.
</p>
<p>
What was my chagrin to hear the Prince's voice in converse with him on the
stair!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here is a pretty pickle!&rdquo; I told myself. &ldquo;M. Albany is the last man on
earth I would choose to meet at this moment,&rdquo; and without another
reflection I darted into the adjoining room and shut the door. It was
Thurot's bed-chamber, with a window that looked out upon the court where
fowls were cackling. I was no sooner in than I somewhat rued my
precipitation, for the manlier course indubitably had been to bide where I
was. But now there was no retreating, so I sat with what patience I could
command to wait my discovery by the tenant of the place after his royal
visitor was gone.
</p>
<p>
It was the Sabbath day as I have said, and the chimes of St. Eloi were
going briskly upon some papist canticle, but not so loud that I could not
hear, in spite of myself, all that went on in the next room.
</p>
<p>
At first I paid no heed, for the situation was unworthy enough of itself
without any attempt on my part to be an eavesdropper. But by-and-bye,
through the banging of the bells of St. Eloi, I heard M. Albany (still to
give the man his by-name) mention the name Ecosse.
</p>
<p>
Scotland! The name of her went through me like a pang!
</p>
<p>
They spoke in French of course; I think I could have understood them had
it been Chinese. For they discussed some details of the intended invasion
that still hung fire, and from the first of M. Albany's sentences I
learned that the descent was determined upon Scotland. 'Twas that which
angered me and made me listen for the rest with every sense of the spy and
deterred by never a scruple. At first I had fancied Thurot would learn
from his servant I was in the house, and leave me alone till his royal
guest's departure from an intuition that I desired no meeting, but it was
obvious now that no such consideration would have induced him to let me
hear the vast secret they discussed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Twenty thousand men are between Brest and Vannes,&rdquo; said M. Albany. &ldquo;We
shall have them in frigates in a fortnight from to-day, and then, <i>mon
Capitaine</i>, affairs shall move briskly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And still,&rdquo; said Thurot, who had some odd tone of dissatisfaction in his
voice, &ldquo;I had preferred it had been the South of England. Dumont has given
us every anchorage and sounding on the coast between Beachy Head and
Arundel, and from there we could all the sooner have thrust at the heart
of England. This Scotland&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bah! Captain Thurot,&rdquo; cried his Royal Highness impatiently, &ldquo;you talk
like a fool. At the heart, indeed! With all habitable England like a fat
about it, rich with forts and troops and no more friendship for us than
for the Mameluke! No, no, Thurot, I cry Scotland; all the chances are
among the rocks, and I am glad it has been so decided on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And still, with infinite deference, your Royal Highness, this same West
of Scotland never brought but the most abominable luck to you and yours,&rdquo;
 continued Thurot. &ldquo;Now, Arundel Bay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! to the devil with Arundel Bay!&rdquo; cried M. Albany; &ldquo;'tis settled
otherwise, and you must take it as you find it. Conflans and his men shall
land upon the West&mdash;<i>mon Dieu!</i> I trust they may escape its
fangs; and measures will be there taken with more precaution and I hope
with more success than in Seventeen Forty-five. Thence they will march to
England, sweeping the whole country before them, and not leaving behind
them a man or boy who can carry a musket. Thus they must raise the army to
fifty or sixty thousand men, strike a terror into England, and carry all
with a high hand. I swear 'tis a fatted hog this England: with fewer than
ten thousand Highlanders I have made her thrill at the very vitals.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thurot hummed. Plainly there was much in the project that failed to meet
his favour.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Conflans?&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
His Royal Highness laughed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha! Captain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I know, I know. 'Twould suit you better if a
certain Tony Thurot had command.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Thurot, &ldquo;I am in my prime, while the Marshal is beyond
his grand climacteric.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And still, by your leave, with the reputation of being yet the best&mdash;
well, let us say among the best&mdash;of the sea officers of France. Come,
come, Captain, there must be no half-hearts in this venture; would to
Heaven I were permitted to enjoy a share in it! And on you, my friend,
depends a good half of the emprise and the <i>gloire</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Gloire!</i>&rdquo; cried Thurot. &ldquo;With every deference to your Royal
Highness I must consider myself abominably ill-used in this matter. That I
should be sent off to Norway and hound-in wretched Swedes with a personage
like Flaubert! Oh, I protest, 'tis beyond all reason! Is it for that I
have been superseded by a man like Conflans that totters on the edge of
the grave?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope 'tis England's grave,&rdquo; retorted M. Albany with unfailing good
humour, and I heard the gluck of wine as he helped himself to another
glass. &ldquo;I repeat <i>gloire</i>, with every apology to the experience of M.
le Corsair. 'Tis your duty to advance with your French and your Swedes
upon the North of England, and make the diversion in these parts that
shall inconvenience the English army front or rear.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, curse your diversions!&rdquo; cried Thurot. &ldquo;If I have a talent at all 'tis
for the main attack. And this Conflans&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The remainder of the discussion, so far as I remained to hear it, gave no
enlargement upon the plan thus laid bare. But in any case my whole desire
now was to escape from the house without discovery, for I had news that
made my return to Britain imperative.
</p>
<p>
I opened the window quietly and slipped out. The drop to the court was
less than my own height. Into the street I turned with the sober step of
leisure, yet my feet tingled to run hard and my heart was stormy. The
bells of St. Eloi went on ringing; the streets were growing busy with
holiday-makers and the soldiers who were destined to over-run my country.
I took there and then the most dreadful hatred of them, and scowled so
black that some of the soldiers cried after me with a jeer.
</p>
<p>
The priest and Kilbride I found were not at the inn where I had left them,
having gone back to the vessel, so I hurried down to the quay after them.
The hoy had been moved since morning, and in the throng of other vessels
that were in the harbour at the time I lost well-nigh an hour in seeking
her. Whether that was well for me or ill would be folly now to guess, but
when I had no more than set a foot upon the gunwale of a small boat that
was to take me out to her I was clapped upon the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
I turned, to see Thurot and two officers of marine!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon, M. Greig, a moment,&rdquo; said Thurot, with not the kindest of tones.
&ldquo;Surely you would not hurry out of Dunkerque without a <i>congé</i> for
old friends?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I stammered some sentences that were meant to reassure him. He interrupted
me, and&mdash;not with any roughness, but with a pressure there was no
mistaking and I was not fool enough to resist&mdash;led me from the side
of the quay.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;'Tis the most ridiculous thing! I had nearly
missed you and could never have forgiven myself. My Swiss has just
informed me that you were in the house an hour ago while I was there
myself. I fear we must have bored you, M. Albany and I, with our dull
affairs. At least there was no other excuse for your unceremonious
departure through my back window.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I was never well-equipped to conceal my feelings, and it was plain in my
face that I knew all.
</p>
<p>
He sighed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, lad,&rdquo; said he, rather sorrowfully, &ldquo;I'd give a good many <i>louis
d'or</i> that you had come visiting at another hour of the day, and now
there's but one thing left me. My Swiss did not know you, but he has&mdash;praise
<i>le bon Dieu!</i>&mdash;a pair of eyes in his head, and he remembered
that my visitor wore red shoes. Red shoes and a Scotsman!&mdash;the
conjunction was unmistakable, and here we are, M. Greig. There are a score
of men looking all over Dunkerque at this moment for these same shoes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Confound the red shoes!&rdquo; I cried, unable to conceal my vexation that they
should once more have brought me into trouble.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By no means, M. Greig,&rdquo; said Thurot. &ldquo;But for them we should never have
identified our visitor, and a somewhat startling tale was over the Channel
a little earlier than we intended. And now all that I may do for old
friendship to yourself and the original wearer of the shoes is to give you
a free trip to England in my own vessel. 'Tis not the <i>Roi Rouge</i>
this time&mdash;worse luck!&mdash;but a frigate, and we can be happy
enough if you are not a fool.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXXVIII
</h2>
<h3>
THUROT'S PRISONER. MY FRIEND THE WATCH
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was plain from the first that my overhearing of the plot must compel
Thurot to the step he took. He was not unkind, but so much depended on the
absolute secrecy of the things he had talked to the Prince, that, even at
the unpleasant cost of trepanning me, he must keep me from carrying my
new-got information elsewhere. For that reason he refused to accede to my
request for a few minutes' conversation with the priest or my
fellow-countrymen. The most ordinary prudence, he insisted, demanded that
he should keep me in a sort of isolation until it was too late to convey a
warning across the Channel.
</p>
<p>
It was for these reasons I was taken that Sabbath afternoon to the frigate
that was destined to be in a humble sense his flagship, and was lying in
the harbour with none of her crew as yet on board. I was given a cabin;
books were furnished to cheer my incarceration, for it was no less. I was
to all intents and purposes a prisoner, though enjoying again some of the
privileges of the <i>salle d'épreuves</i> for the sake of old
acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
All that day I planned escape. Thurot came to the cabin and smoked and
conversed pleasantly, but found me so abstracted that he could scarcely
fail to think I meant a counter-sap.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Be tranquil, my Paul,&rdquo; he advised; &ldquo;Clancarty and I will make your life
on ship-board as little irksome as possible, but it is your own cursed
luck that you must make up your mind to a fortnight of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But that was considerably longer than I was ready to think of with
equanimity. What I wished for was an immediate freedom and a ship to
England, and while he talked I reviewed a dozen methods of escape. Here
was I with a secret worth a vast deal to the British Government; if I
could do my country that service of putting her into possession of it in
time to prevent catastrophe, might I not, without presumption, expect some
clemency from her laws for the crime I had committed in the hot blood of
ignorant and untutored youth? I saw the most cheerful possibilities rise
out of that accident that had made me an eavesdropper in Thurot's lodging&mdash;freedom,
my family perhaps restored to me, my name partly re-established; but the
red shoes that set me on wrong roads to start with still kept me on them.
Thurot was an amiable enough gaoler, but not his best wine nor his
wittiest stories might make me forget by how trivial a chance I had lost
my opportunity.
</p>
<p>
We were joined in the afternoon by Lord Clancarty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, lad!&rdquo; cried his lordship, pomaded and scented beyond words; fresh,
as he told us, from the pursuit of a lady whose wealth was shortly to
patch up his broken fortunes. &ldquo;What, lad! Here's a pretty matter! Pressed,
egad! A renegade against his will! 'Tis the most cursed luck, Captain
Thurot, and wilt compel the poor young gentleman to cut the throats of his
own countrymen?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I? Faith, not I!&rdquo; said Thurot. &ldquo;I press none but filthy Swedes. M. Greig
has my word for it that twelve hours before we weigh anchor he may take
his leave of us. <i>Je le veux bien</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bah! 'Tis an impolite corsair this. As for me I should be inconsolable to
lose M. Greig to such a dull country as this England. Here's an Occasion,
M. le Capitaine, for pledging his health in a bottle, and wishing him well
out of his troubles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You do not stand sufficiently on your dignity, Clancarty,&rdquo; laughed
Thurot. &ldquo;Here's the enemy&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dignity! pooh!&rdquo; said his lordship. &ldquo;To stand on that I should need a
year's practice first on the tight-rope. There's that about an Irish
gentleman that makes the posturings and proprieties and pretences of the
fashionable world unnecessary. Sure, race will show in his face and action
if he stood alone in his shirt-sleeves on a village common juggling balls.
I am of the oldest blood that springs in Irish kings. 'Tis that knowledge
keeps my heart up when circumstances make the world look rotten like a
cheese. But the curst thing is one cannot for ever be drinking and dining
off a pedigree, and here I am deserted by M. Tête-de-mouche&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thurot put up his hand to check one of these disloyalties to the Pretender
that I had long since learned were common with Lord Clancarty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried his lordship. &ldquo;I love you, Tony, and all the other boys, but
your Prince is a madman&mdash;a sotted madman tied to the petticoat tails
of a trollope. This Walkinshaw&mdash;saving your presence, Paul Greig, for
she's your countrywoman and by way of being your friend, I hear&mdash;has
ruined Charles and the Cause. We have done what we could to make him send
madame back to the place she came from, but he'll do nothing of the kind.
'She has stuck by me through thick and thin, and lost all for me, and now
I shall stick by her,' says foolish Master Sentiment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Thurot. &ldquo;'Tis these things make us love the Prince and have
faith in his ultimate success.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were ever the hopeful ass, Tony,&rdquo; said his lordship coolly. &ldquo;<i>Il
riest pire sourd que celui qui ne veut pas entendre</i>, and you must shut
your ears against a tale that all the world is shouting at the pitch of
its voice. Who knows better than Tony Thurot how his Royal Highness has
declined? Why! 'tis manifest in the fellow's nose; I declare he drinks
like a fish&mdash;another vice he brought back from your mountain land, M.
Greig, along with Miss Walkinshaw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is far too much of Miss Walkinshaw about your lordship's remarks,&rdquo;
 I cried in an uncontrollable heat that the lady should be the subject of
implications so unkind.
</p>
<p>
He stared, and then kissed his hand to me with laughter and a bow, &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;
 he cried, &ldquo;here's another young gentleman of sentiment. Stap me if I say a
word against the lady for your sake, Andy Greig's nephew.&rdquo; And back he
went to his bottle.
</p>
<p>
In this light fashion we spent a day that by rights should have been more
profitably and soberly occupied. The frigate lay well out from the quays
from which Thurot had conveyed me with none of the indignities that might
be expected by a prisoner. There was, as I have said, none of her crew on
board save a watch of two men. Beside her quarter there hung a small
smuggling cutter that had been captured some days previously. As I sat in
the cabin, yawning at the hinder-end over Clancarty's sallies, I could
hear now and then the soft thudding of the smuggler's craft against the
fenders as the sea rocked us lightly, and it put a mad fancy into my head.
</p>
<p>
How good it would be, I thought, to be free on board such a vessel and
speeding before a light wind to Britain! Was it wholly impossible? The
notion so possessed me that I took an occasion to go on deck and see how
things lay.
</p>
<p>
The smuggler's boat had her mast stepped, but no sails in her. Over the
bulwark of the frigate leaned one of the watch idly looking at sea-gulls
that cried like bairns upon the smuggler's thwarts and gunnels. He was a
tarry Dutchman (by his build and colour); I fancy that at the time he
never suspected I was a prisoner, for he saluted me with deference.
</p>
<p>
The harbour was emptier than usual of shipping. Dusk was falling on the
town; some lights were twinkling wanly and bells rang in the cordage of
the quays. I asked the seaman if he knew where the hoy <i>Vrijster</i> of
Helvoetsluys lay.
</p>
<p>
At that his face brightened and he promptly pointed to her yellow hull on
the opposite side of the harbour.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did my honour know Captain Breuer?&rdquo; he asked, in crabbed French.
</p>
<p>
My honour was very pleased to confess that he did, though in truth my
acquaintance with the skipper who had taken us round from Helvoetsluys
went scarcely further than sufficed me to recall his name.
</p>
<p>
The best sailor ever canted ship! my Dutchman assured me with enthusiasm.
How often have I heard the self-same sentiment from mariners? for there is
something jovial and kind in the seaman's manner that makes him ever fond
of the free, the brave and competent of his own calling, and ready to cry
their merits round the rolling world.
</p>
<p>
A good seaman certainly!&mdash;I agreed heartily, though the man might
have been merely middling for all I knew of him.
</p>
<p>
He would like nothing better than to have an hour with Captain Breuer,
said Mynheer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I, too,&rdquo; said I quickly. &ldquo;But for Captain Thurot's pressing desire
that I should spend the evening here I should be in Breuer's cabin now.
Next to being with him there I would reckon the privilege of having him
here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There might be very little difficulty about that if my honour was willing,
said Mynheer. They were old shipmates; had sailed the Zuyder Sea together,
and drunken in a score of ports. Dearly indeed would he love to have some
discourse with Breuer. But to take leave from the frigate and cross to the
hoy&mdash;no! Captain Thurot would not care for him to do that.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not have Breuer come to the frigate?&rdquo; I asked, with my heart beating
fast.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo; repeated Mynheer with a laugh. &ldquo;A hail across the harbour
would not fetch him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then go for him,&rdquo; said I, my heart beating faster than ever lest he
should have some suspicion of my condition and desires.
</p>
<p>
He reminded me that he had no excuse to leave the frigate, though to take
the small boat at the stern and row over to the hoy would mean but a
minute or two.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, as for excuses,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that's easily arranged, for I can give
you one to carry a note to the care of the captain, and you may take it at
your leisure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At his leisure! He would take it at once and thankfully while we gentlemen
were drinking below, for there was no pleasure under heaven he could
compare with half an hour of good Jan Breuer's company.
</p>
<p>
Without betraying my eagerness to avail myself of such an unlooked-for
opportunity, I deliberately wrote a note in English intimating that I was
a prisoner on the frigate and in pressing humour to get out of her at the
earliest moment. I addressed it to Kilbride, judging the Highlander more
likely than Father Hamilton to take rational steps for my release if that
were within the bounds of possibility.
</p>
<p>
I assured the seaman that if he lost no time in taking it over I would
engage his absence would never be noticed, and he agreed to indicate to me
by a whistle when he returned.
</p>
<p>
With a cheerful assurance that he would have Jan Breuer on this deck in
less than twenty minutes the seaman loosed the painter of the small boat
and set forth upon his errand, while I returned to the cabin where Thurot
and Clancarty still talked the most contrary and absurd politics over
their wine. The vast and tangled scheme of French intrigue was set before
me; at another time it might have been of the most fascinating interest,
but on this particular occasion I could not subdue my mind to matters so
comparatively trivial, while I kept my hearing strained for the evidence
that the Dutchman had accomplished his mission and got back.
</p>
<p>
The moments passed; the interest flagged; Clancarty began to yawn and
Thurot grew silent. It was manifest that the sooner my Dutchman was back
to his ship the better for my plan. Then it was I showed the brightest
interest in affairs that an hour earlier failed to engage a second of my
attention, and I discovered for the entertainment of my gaoler and his
friend a hitherto unsuspected store of reminiscence about my Uncle Andrew
and a fund of joke and anecdote whereof neither of them probably had
thought me capable.
</p>
<p>
But all was useless. The signal that the Dutchman had returned was not
made when Lord Clancarty rose to his feet and intimated his intention
there and then of going ashore, though his manner suggested that it would
have been easy to induce him to wait longer. We went on deck with him. The
night was banked with clouds though a full moon was due; only a few stars
shone in the spaces of the zenith; our vessel was in darkness except where
a lamp swung at the bow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Tony, what a pitchy night! I'd liefer be safe ashore
than risking my life getting there in your cockle-shell,&rdquo; said Clancarty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Art all right, Lord Clancarty,&rdquo; said Thurot. &ldquo;Here's a man will row you
to the quay in two breaths, and you'll be snug in bed before M. Greig and
I have finished our prayers.&rdquo; Then he cried along the deck for the seaman.
</p>
<p>
I felt that all was lost now the fellow's absence was to be discovered.
</p>
<p>
What was my astonishment to hear an answering call, and see the Dutchman's
figure a blotch upon the blackness of the after-deck.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bring round the small boat and take Lord Clancarty ashore,&rdquo; said the
captain, and the seaman hastened to do so. He sprang into the small boat,
released her rope, and brought her round.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>A demain</i>, dear Paul,&rdquo; cried his lordship with a hiccough. &ldquo;It's
curst unkind of Tony Thurot not to let you ashore on parole or permit me
to wait with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The boat dropped off into the darkness of the harbour, her oars thudding
on the thole-pins.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There goes a decent fellow though something of a fool,&rdquo; said Thurot.
&ldquo;'Tis his kind have made so many enterprises like our own have an
ineffectual end. And now you must excuse me, M. Greig, if I lock you into
your cabin. There are too few of us on board to let you have the run of
the vessel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He put a friendly hand upon the shoulder I shrugged with chagrin at this
conclusion to an unfortunate day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sorry, M. Greig, sorry,&rdquo; he said humorously. &ldquo;<i>Qui commence mal finit
mal</i>, and I wish to heaven you had begun the day by finding Antoine
Thurot at home, in which case we had been in a happier relationship
to-night.&rdquo;

CHAPTER XXXIX
</h2>
<h3>
DISCLOSES THE MANNER OF MY ESCAPE AND HOW WE SET SAIL FOR ALBION
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hurot turned the key on me with a pleasantry that was in no accordance
with my mood, and himself retired to the round house on deck where his
berth was situated. I sat on a form for a little, surrendered all to
melancholy, then sought to remove it by reading, as sleep in my present
humour was out of the question. My reading, though it lasted for an hour
or two, was scarcely worth the name, for my mind continually wandered from
the page. I wondered if my note to Kilbride had been delivered, and if any
step on his part was to be expected therefrom; the hope that rose with
that reflection died at once upon the certainty that as the Dutch seaman
had not signalled as he had promised he had somehow learned the true
nature of my condition in the frigate. Had he told Thurot? If he had told
Thurot&mdash;which was like enough&mdash;that I had communicated with any
one outside the vessel there was little doubt that the latter would take
adequate steps to prevent interference by Kilbride or any one else.
</p>
<p>
We are compact of memories, a mere bundle of bygone days, childish
recollections, ancient impressions, and so an older experience came to me,
too, of the night I sat in the filthy cabin of Dan Risk's doomed vessel
hearing the splash of illegitimate oars, anticipating with a mind scarcely
more disturbed than I had just now the step of the officer from the prison
at Blackness and the clutch of the chilly fetters.
</p>
<p>
There was a faint but rising nor'-east wind. It sighed among the shrouds
of the frigate. I could hear it even in the cabin, pensive like the call
of the curfew at a great distance. The waves washed against the timbers in
curious short gluckings and hissings. On the vessel herself not a sound
was to be heard, until of a sudden there came a scratching at my cabin
door!
</p>
<p>
It was incredible! I had heard no footstep on the companion, and I had
ceased to hope for anything from the Dutchman!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; I asked softly, and at that the key outside was turned and
I was fronted by Kilbride!
</p>
<p>
He wore the most ridiculous travesty of the Dutchman's tarry breeks and
tarpaulin hat and coarse wide jumper, and in the light of my candle there
was a humorous twinkle on his face as he entered, closed the door softly
after him, and sat down beside me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you have a face on you as if you were in a
graveyard watching ghosts. It's time you were steeping the withies to go
away as we say in the Language, and you may be telling me all the story of
it elsewhere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where's the Dutchman that took my letter?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; said Kilbride, &ldquo;but in the place that well befits him&mdash;at
the lug of an anker of Rotterdam gin taking his honest night's rest. I'm
here guizing in his tarry clothes, and if I were Paul Greig of the Hazel
Den I would be clapping on my hat gey quick and getting out of here
without any more parley.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You left him in the hoy!&rdquo; said I astonished.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, there was nothing better for it!&rdquo; said he coolly. &ldquo;Breuer gave him
so much of the juniper for old acquaintance that when I left he was so
full of it that he had lost the power of his legs and you might as well
try to keep a string of fish standing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And it was you took Clancarty ashore?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who else? And I don't think it's a great conceit of myself to believe I
play-acted the Dutch tarry-breeks so very well, though I was in something
of a tremble in case the skipper here would make me out below my guizard's
clothes. You may thank your stars the moon was as late of rising this
night as a man would be that was at a funeral yesterday.&rdquo; &ldquo;And where's the
other man who was on this vessel?&rdquo; I asked, preparing to go.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come on deck and I'll show you,&rdquo; said Kilbride, checking a chuckle of
amusement at something.
</p>
<p>
We crept softly on deck into the night now slightly lit by a moon veiled
by watery clouds. The ship seemed all our own and we were free to leave
her when we chose for the small boat hung at her stern.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were asking for the other one,&rdquo; said Kilbride. &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; and he
pointed to a huddled figure bound upon the waist. &ldquo;When I came on board
after landing Clancarty this stupid fellow discovered I was a stranger and
nearly made an outcry; but I hit him on the lug with the loom of an oar.
He'll not be observing very much for a while yet, but I was bound all the
same to put a rope on him to prevent him disturbing Captain Thurot's sleep
too soon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We spoke in whispers for the night seemed all ear and I was for ever
haunted by the reflection that Thurot was divided from us by little more
than an inch or two of teak-wood. Now and then the moon peeped through a
rift of cloud and lit a golden roadway over the sea, enticing me
irresistibly home.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;O God, I wish I was in Scotland!&rdquo; I said passionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Less luck than that will have to be doing us,&rdquo; said Kilbride, fumbling at
the painter of the boat. &ldquo;The hoy sets sail for Calais in an hour or two,
and it's plain from your letter we'll be best to be taking her round that
length.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not Calais,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It's too serious a business with me for that.
I'm wanting England, and wanting it unco fast.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Oh, Dhe!</i>&rdquo; said my countryman, &ldquo;here's a fellow with the appetite
of Prince Charlie and as likely to gratify it. What for must it be
England, <i>loachain?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can only hint at that,&rdquo; I answered hastily, &ldquo;and that in a minute. Are
ye loyal?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To a fine fellow called MacKellar first and to my king and country
after?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Stuarts?&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
He cracked his thumb. &ldquo;It's all by with that,&rdquo; said he quickly and not
without a tone of bitterness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The breed of them has never been loyal to me, and if I could wipe out of
my life six months of the cursedest folly in Forty-five I would go back to
Scotland with the first chance and throw my bonnet for Geordie ever after
like the greasiest burgess ever sold a wab of cloth or a cargo of Virginia
in Glasgow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you and me's bound for England this night, for I have
that in my knowledge should buy the safety of the pair of us,&rdquo; and I
briefly conveyed my secret.
</p>
<p>
He softly whistled with astonishment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Man! it's a gey taking idea,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;But the bit is to get over
the Channel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have thought of that,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Here's a smuggler wanting no more than
a rag of sail in this wind to make the passage in a couple of days.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the Holy Iron it's the very thing!&rdquo; he interrupted, slapping his leg.
</p>
<p>
It takes a time to tell all this in writing, but in actual fact our whole
conversation together in the cabin and on the deck occupied less than five
minutes. We were both of us too well aware of the value of time to have
had it otherwise and waste moments in useless conversation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is to be done is this,&rdquo; I suggested, casting a rapid glance along
the decks and upwards to the spars. &ldquo;I will rig up a sail of some sort
here and you will hasten over again in the small-boat to the hoy and give
Father Hamilton the option of coming with us. He may or he may not care to
run the risks involved in the exploit, but at least we owe him the offer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But when I'm across at the hoy there, here's you with this dovering body
and Captain Thurot. Another knock might settle the one, but you would
scarcely care to have knocks going in the case of an old friend like Tony
Thurot, who's only doing his duty in keeping you here with such a secret
in your charge.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have thought of that, too,&rdquo; I replied quickly, &ldquo;and I will hazard
Thurot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kilbride lowered himself into the small-boat, pushed off from the side of
the frigate, and in silence half-drifted in the direction of the Dutch
vessel. My plans were as clear in my head as if they had been printed on
paper. First of all I took such provender as I could get from my cabin and
placed it along with a breaker of water and a lamp in the cutter. Then I
climbed the shrouds of the frigate, and cut away a small sail that I
guessed would serve my purpose, letting it fall into the cutter. I made a
shift at sheets and halyards and found that with a little contrivance I
could spread enough canvas to take the cutter in that weather at a fair
speed before the wind that had a blessed disposition towards the coast of
England. I worked so fast it was a miracle, dreading at every rustle of
the stolen sail&mdash;at every creak of the cutter on the fenders, that
either the captain or his unconscious seaman would awake.
</p>
<p>
My work was scarcely done when the small-boat came off again from the hoy,
and as she drew cautiously near I saw that MacKellar had with him the
bulky figure of the priest. He climbed ponderously, at my signal, into the
cutter, and MacKellar joined me for a moment on the deck of the frigate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He goes with us then?&rdquo; I asked, indicating the priest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To the Indies if need be,&rdquo; said Kilbride. &ldquo;But the truth is that this
accident is a perfect God-send to him, for England's the one place below
the firmament he would choose for a refuge at this moment. Is all ready?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If my sail-making's to be relied on she's in the best of trim,&rdquo; I
answered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And&mdash;what do ye call it?&mdash;all found?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A water breaker, a bottle of brandy, a bag of bread&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Enough for a foray of fifty men!&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;Give me meal and
water in the heel of my shoe and I would count it very good vivers for a
fortnight.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He went into the cutter; I released the ropes that bound her to the
frigate and followed him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i> dear lad, 'tis a world of most fantastic happenings,&rdquo; was
all the poor old priest said, shivering in the cold night air.
</p>
<p>
We had to use the oars of the frigate's small-boat for a stroke or two so
as to get the cutter round before the wind; she drifted quickly from the
large ship's side almost like a living thing with a crave for freedom at
last realised; up speedily ran her sail, unhandsome yet sufficient, the
friendly air filled out the rustling folds and drove her through the night
into the open sea.
</p>
<p>
There is something in a moonlit night at sea that must touch in the most
cloddish heart a spring of fancy. It is friendlier than the dawn that at
its most glorious carries a hint of sorrow, or than the bravest sunset
that reminds us life is a brief day at the best of it, and the one thing
sempiternal yet will be the darkness. We sat in the well of the cutter&mdash;three
odd adventurers, myself the most silent because I had the double share of
dubiety about the enterprise, for who could tell how soon the doomster's
hand would be on me once my feet were again on British soil? Yet now when
I think of it&mdash;of the moonlit sea, the swelling sail above us, the
wake behind that shone with fire&mdash;I must count it one of the happiest
experiences of my life.
</p>
<p>
The priest looked back at the low land of France receding behind us, with
its scattered lights on the harbour and the shore, mere subjects to the
queenly moon. &ldquo;There goes poor Father Hamilton,&rdquo; said he whimsically,
&ldquo;happy schoolboy, foolish lover in Louvain that had never but moonlit
eves, parish priest of Dixmunde working two gardens, human and divine,
understanding best the human where his bees roved, but loving all men good
and ill. There goes the spoiled page, the botched effort, and here's a fat
old man at the start of a new life, and never to see his darling France
again. Ah! the good mother; <i>Dieu te bénisse!</i>&rdquo;

CHAPTER XL
</h2>
<h3>
MY INTERVIEW WITH PITT
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>f our voyage across the Channel there need be no more said than that it
was dull to the very verge of monotony, for the wind, though favourable,
was often in a faint where our poor sail shook idly at the mast. Two days
later we were in London, and stopped at the Queen's Head above Craig's
Court in Charing Cross.
</p>
<p>
And now I had to make the speediest possible arrangement for a meeting
with those who could make the most immediate and profitable use of the
tidings I was in a position to lay before them, by no means an easy matter
to decide upon for a person who had as little knowledge of London as he
had of the Cities of the Plain.
</p>
<p>
MacKellar&mdash;ever the impetuous Gael&mdash;was for nothing less than a
personal approach to his Majesty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man that is on the top of the hill will always be seeing furthest,&rdquo;
 he said. &ldquo;I have come in contact with the best in Europe on that under
standing, but it calls for a kind of Hielan' tact that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That you cannot credit to a poor Lowlander like myself,&rdquo; said I, amused
at his vanity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I'm meaning no offence, just no offence at all,&rdquo; he responded
quickly, and flushing at his <i>faux pas</i>. &ldquo;You have as much talent of
the kind as the best of us I'm not denying, and I have just the one
advantage, that I was brought up in a language that has delicacies of
address beyond the expression of the English, or the French that is, in
some measure, like it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the spirit of it is obviously not to be translated into
English, judging from the way you go on crying up your countrymen at the
expense of my own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is true enough,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;and a very just observe; but no
matter, what I would be at is that your news is worth too much to be
wasted on any poor lackey hanging about his Majesty's back door, who might
either sell it or you on his own behoof, or otherwise make a mull of the
matter with the very best intentions. If you would take my way of it,
there would be but Geordie himself for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What have you to say to that?&rdquo; I asked the priest, whose knowledge of the
world struck me as in most respects more trustworthy than that of this
impetuous Highland chirurgeon.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A plague of your kings! say I; sure I know nothing about them, for my
luck has rubbed me against the gabardine and none of your ermined cloaks.
There must be others who know his Majesty's affairs better than his
Majesty himself, otherwise what advantage were there in being a king?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In fine his decision was for one of the Ministers, and at last the
Secretary of State was decided on.
</p>
<p>
How I came to meet with Mr. Pitt need not here be recorded; 'twas indeed
more a matter of good luck than of good guidance, and had there been no
Scots House of Argyll perhaps I had never got rid of my weighty secret
after all. I had expected to meet a person magnificent in robes of state;
instead of which 'twas a man in a blue coat with yellow metal buttons,
full round bob wig, a large hat, and no sword-bag nor ruffles that met me&mdash;more
like a country coachman or a waggoner than a personage of importance.
</p>
<p>
He scanned over again the letter that had introduced me and received me
cordially enough. In a few words I indicated that I was newly come from
France, whence I had escaped in a smuggler's boat, and that I had news of
the first importance which I counted it my duty to my country to convey to
him with all possible expedition.
</p>
<p>
At that his face changed and he showed singularly little eagerness to hear
any more.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There will be&mdash;there will be the&mdash;the usual bargain, I presume,
Mr. Greig?&rdquo; he said, half-smiling. &ldquo;What are the conditions on which I am
to have this vastly important intelligence?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never dreamt of making any, sir,&rdquo; I answered, promptly, with some
natural chagrin, and yet mixed with a little confusion that I should in
truth be expecting something in the long run for my story.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon my stupid pleasantry, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; he said, reddening slightly. &ldquo;I
have been so long one of his Majesty's Ministers, and of late have seen so
many urgent couriers from France with prime news to be bargained for, that
I have grown something of a cynic. You are the first that has come with a
secret not for sale. Believe me, your story will have all the more
attention because it is offered disinterestedly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In twenty minutes I had put him into possession of all I knew of the plans
for invasion. He walked up and down the room, with his hands behind his
back, intently listening, now and then uttering an exclamation incredulous
or astonished.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are sure of all this?&rdquo; he asked at last sharply, looking in my face
with embarrassing scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As sure as any mortal man may be with the gift of all his senses,&rdquo; I
replied firmly. &ldquo;At this moment Thurot's vessel is, I doubt not, taking in
her stores; the embarkation of troops is being practised daily, troops are
assembled all along the coast from Brest to Vannes, and&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! on these points we are, naturally, not wholly dark,&rdquo; said the
Minister. &ldquo;We have known for a year of this somewhat theatrical display on
the part of the French, but the lines of the threatened invasion are not
such as your remarkable narrative suggests. You have been good enough to
honour me with your confidence, Mr. Greig; let me reciprocate by telling
you that we have our&mdash;our good friends in France, and that for six
months back I have been in possession of the Chevalier D'Arcy's
instructions to Dumont to reconnoitre the English coast, and of Dumont's
report, with the chart of the harbours and towns where he proposed that
the descent should be made.&rdquo; He smiled somewhat grimly. &ldquo;The gentleman who
gave us the information,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;stipulated for twenty thousand
pounds and a pension of two thousand a year as the just reward for his
loving service to his country in her hour of peril. He was not to get his
twenty thousand, I need scarcely say, but he was to get something in the
event of his intelligence proving to be accurate, and if it were for no
more than to get the better of such a dubious patriot I should wish his
tale wholly disproved, though we have hitherto acted on the assumption
that it might be trustworthy. There cannot be alternative plans of
invasion; our informant&mdash;another Scotsman, I may say&mdash;is either
lying or has merely the plan of a feint.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are most kind, sir,&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I take your story first, and as probably the most correct,
simply because it comes from one that loves his country and makes no
bagman's bargains for the sale of secrets vital to her existence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am much honoured, sir,&rdquo; said I, with a bow.
</p>
<p>
And then he stopped his walk abruptly and faced me again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have told me, Mr. Greig,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that Conflans is to descend in
a week or two on the coast of Scotland, and that Thurot is to create a
diversion elsewhere with the aid of the Swedes, I have, from the most
delicate considerations, refrained from asking you how you know all this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I heard it from the lips of Thurot himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thurot! impossible!&rdquo; he murmured.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of Thurot himself, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must be much in that pirate's confidence,&rdquo; said Mr. Pitt, for the
first time with suspicion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not to that extent that he would tell me of his plans for invading my
country,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and I learned these things by the merest accident.
I overheard him speak last Sunday in Dunkerque with the Young Pretender&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Pretender!&rdquo; cried the Minister, shrugging his shoulders, and looking
at me with more suspicion than ever. &ldquo;You apparently move in the most
select and interesting society, Mr. Greig?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In this case, sir, it was none of my choosing,&rdquo; I replied, and went on
briefly to explain how I had got into Thurot's chamber unknown to him, and
unwittingly overhead the Prince and him discuss the plan.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very good, very good, and still&mdash;you will pardon me&mdash;I cannot
see how so devout a patriot as Mr. Greig should be in the intimacy of men
like Thurot?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A most natural remark under the circumstances,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Thurot saved
my life from a sinking British vessel, and it is no more than his due to
say he proved a very good friend to me many a time since. But I was to
know nothing of his plans of invasion, for he knew very well I had no
sympathy with them nor with Charles Edward, and, as I have told you, he
made me his prisoner on his ship so that I might not betray what I had
overheard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Minister made hurried notes of what I had told him, and concluded the
interview by asking where I could be communicated with during the next few
days.
</p>
<p>
I gave him my direction at the Queen's Head, but added that I had it in my
mind to go shortly to Edinburgh, where my address would be best known to
the Lord Advocate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Lord Advocate!&rdquo; said Mr. Pitt, raising his eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I may as well make a clean breast of it, sir,&rdquo; I proceeded hurriedly,
&ldquo;and say that I left Scotland under circumstances peculiarly distressing.
Thurot saved me from a ship called the <i>Seven Sisters</i>, that had been
scuttled and abandoned with only myself and a seaman on board of her in
mid-channel, by a man named Daniel Risk.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; cried Mr. Pitt, &ldquo;the scoundrel Risk was tried in Edinburgh a
month or two ago on several charges, including the one you mention, and he
has either been hanged, or is waiting to be hanged at this moment, in the
jail at Edinburgh.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was nominally purser on the <i>Seven Sisters</i>, but in actual fact I
was fleeing from justice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Minister hemmed, and fumbled with his papers.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was owing to a duelling affair, in which I had the misfortune to&mdash;to&mdash;kill
my opponent. I desire, sir, above all, to be thoroughly honest, and I am
bound to tell you it was my first intention to make the conveyance of this
plan of Thurot's a lever to secure my pardon for the crime of manslaughter
which lies at my charge. I would wish now that my loyalty to my country
was really disinterested, and I have, in the last half-hour, made up my
mind to surrender myself to the law of Scotland.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is for yourself to decide on,&rdquo; said the Minister more gravely, &ldquo;but
I should advise the postponement of your departure to Edinburgh until you
hear further from me. I shall expect to find you at the inn at Charing
Cross during the next week; thereafter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He paused for a moment. &ldquo;Well&mdash;thereafter we shall see,&rdquo; he added.
</p>
<p>
After a few more words of the kindest nature the Minister shook hands with
the confessed manslayer (it flashed on me as a curious circumstance), and
I went back to join the priest and my fellow countryman.
</p>
<p>
They were waiting full of impatience.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hast the King's pardon in thy pocket, friend Scotland?&rdquo; cried Father
Hamilton; then his face sank in sympathy with the sobriety of my own that
was due to my determination on a surrender to justice once my business
with the Government was over.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no more in my pocket than I went out with in the morning,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;But my object, so far, has been served. Mr. Pitt knows my story and is
like to take such steps as maybe needful. As for my own affair I have
mentioned it, but it has gone no further than that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're not telling me you did not make a bargain of it before saying a
word about the bit plan?&rdquo; cried MacKellar in surprise, and could scarcely
find words strong enough to condemn me for what he described as my
stupidity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Many a man will sow the seed that will never eat the syboe,&rdquo; was his
comment; &ldquo;and was I not right yonder when I said yon about the tact? If it
had been me now I would have gone very canny to the King himself and said:
'Your Majesty, I'm a man that has made a slip in a little affair as
between gentlemen, and had to put off abroad until the thing blew by. I
can save the lives of many thousand Englishmen, and perhaps the country
itself, by intelligence that came to my knowledge when I was abroad; if I
prove it, will your Majesty pardon the thing that lies at my charge?'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And would have his Majesty's signature to the promise as 'twere a deed of
sale!&rdquo; laughed the priest convulsively. &ldquo;La! la! la! Paul, here's our
Celtic Solon with tact&mdash;the tact of the foot-pad. Stand and deliver!
My pardon, sire, or your life! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> there runs much of the old
original cateran in thy methods of diplomacy, good Master MacKellar. Too
much for royal courts, I reckon.&rdquo; MacKellar pshawed impatiently. &ldquo;I'm
asking you what is the Secretary's name, Mr. Greig?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Fox or Pitt
it is all the same&mdash;the one is sly and the other is deep, and it is
the natures of their names. I'll warrant Mr. Pitt has forgotten already
the name of the man who gave him the secret, and the wisest thing Paul
Greig could do now would be to go into hiding as fast as he can.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But I expressed my determination to wait in the Queen's Head a week
longer, as I had promised, and thereafter (if nothing happened to prevent
it) to submit myself at Edinburgh. Though I tried to make as little of
that as possible to myself, and indeed would make myself believe I was
going to act with a rare bravery, I must confess now that my determination
was strengthened greatly by the reflection that my service to the country
would perhaps annul or greatly modify my sentence.

CHAPTER XLI
</h2>
<h3>
TREATS OF FATHER HAMILTON'S DEATH
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a gay place, London, in the days I write of, however it may be now,
though Father Hamilton was prone occasionally to compare it unfavourably
with the Paris of his fancy, the which he held a sample-piece of paradise.
The fogs and rains depressed him; he had an eye altogether unfriendly for
the signs of striving commerce in the streets and the greedy haste of
clerks and merchants into whose days of unremitting industry so few joys
(as he fancied) seemed to enter.
</p>
<p>
MacKellar soon found company in it among silken bucks that held noisy
sederunts in the evenings at a place called White's and another called (if
my memory does not fail me) the Cocoa Nut Tree. 'Twas marvellous the
number of old friends and fellow countrymen that, by his own account, he
found there. And what open hands they had! But for him that was
privileged, for old acquaintance sake, to borrow from them, we had found
our week or two in London singularly hungry because (to tell the truth of
it) our money was come very nearly to an end. But MacKellar, who had
foraged so well in Silesia, was equally good at it in the city of London.
From these night escapades he seldom failed to return richer than he went,
and it was he who paid the piper with so much of an air of thinking it a
privilege, that we had not the heart, even if we had the inclination, to
protest.
</p>
<p>
If I had known then, as I know now, or at least suspect, that the money
that fed and boarded us was won through his skill at dice and cards, I
daresay I had shifted sooner from London than I did at the last.
</p>
<p>
Day after day passed, and no word from Mr. Pitt. I dared scarcely leave my
inn for an hour's airing lest I should be asked for in my absence. There
was, for a while, a hope that though I had refused to make any bargain
about the pardon, something&mdash;I could not so much as guess what&mdash;might
happen to avert the scandal of a trial at Edinburgh, and the disgrace that
same might bring upon my family. But day after day passed, as I have said,
and there came no hint of how matters stood.
</p>
<p>
And then there came a day when I was to consider it mattered very little
whether I heard from Pitt or not; when even my country was forgotten and I
was to suffer a loss whose bitterness abides with me yet. It was the death
of Father Hamilton, whom I had grown to like exceedingly. Birds have built
and sung for many generations since then; children play in the garden
still; there is essence at the table, there is sparkle in the wine, and he
will never enjoy them any more. Fortune has come to me since then, so that
I might have the wherewithal, if I had the wish, to take the road again
with him in honesty, and see it even better than when Sin paid the bill
for us, but it cannot be with him.
</p>
<p>
It was a December day of the whitest, the city smothered in snow, its
tumult hushed. I had been tempted to wander in the forenoon a good way
from our lodging. Coming home in the afternoon I met Kilbride, distracted,
setting out to seek for me. He had a face like the clay, and his hands,
that grasped my lapels as if I meant to fly from him, were trembling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Paul,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Here's the worst of all,&rdquo; and I declare his cheeks
were wet with tears.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I cried in great alarm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The priest, the priest,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He's lying yonder at the ebb, and I'm
no more use to him than if I were a bairn. I've seen the death-thraws a
thousand times, but never to vex me just like this before. He could make
two or three of us in bulk, and yet his heart was like a wean's, and there
he's crying on you even-on till I was near demented and must run about the
streets to seek for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But still you give me no clue!&rdquo; I cried, hurrying home with him.
</p>
<p>
He gave me the story by the way. It seemed his reverence had had a notion
to see Eastcheap, round which the writer Shakespeare had thrown a glamour
for him. He had gone there shortly after I had gone out in the forenoon,
and after a space of walking about it had found himself in a mean street
where a blackguard was beating a child. 'Twas the man's own child,
doubtless, and so he had, I make no doubt, the law of it on his own side,
but the drunken wretch outdid all reasonable chastisement, and thrashed
her till the blood flowed.
</p>
<p>
Up ran the priest and took her in his arms, shielding her from the blows
of the father's cudgel with his arm. The child nuzzled to his breast,
shrieking, and the father tried to pull her away. Between them she fell;
the priest stood over her, keeping back the beast that threatened. The man
struck at him with his stick; Father Hamilton wrenched it from him, threw
it down that he might have no unfair advantage, and flung himself upon the
wretch. He could have crushed him into jelly, but the man was armed, and
suddenly drew a knife. He thrust suddenly between the priest's shoulders,
released himself from the tottering body, and disappeared with his child
apparently beyond all chance of identification or discovery.
</p>
<p>
Father Hamilton was carried home upon a litter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;O God! Kilbride, and must he die?&rdquo; I cried in horror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He will travel in less than an hour,&rdquo; said the Highlander, vastly moved.
&ldquo;And since he came here his whole cry has been for you and Father Joyce.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We went into the room that seemed unnaturally white and sunny. He lay upon
the bed-clothes. The bed was drawn towards the window, through which the
domes and towers and roofs of London could be seen, with their accustomed
greyness gone below the curtain of the snow. A blotch of blood was on his
shirt-front as he lay upon his side. I thought at first it was his own
life oozing, but learned a little later that the stricken child had had
her face there.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Paul! Paul!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought thou wouldst blame me for deserting thee
again, and this time without so much as a letter of farewell.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
What could I do but take his hand, and fall upon my knees beside his bed?
He had blue eyes that never aged nor grossened&mdash;the eyes of a boy,
clear, clean, and brave, and round about them wrinkles played in a sad,
sweet smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, Paul!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all this for behemoth! for the old man of the sea
that has stuck on thy shoulders for a twelvemonth, and spurred thee to
infinite follies and perils! I am no more worth a tear of thine than is
the ivied ash that falls untimely and decayed, eaten out of essence by the
sins he sheltered. And the poor child, Paul!&mdash;the poor child with her
arms round my neck, her tears brine&mdash;sure I have them on my lips&mdash;the
true <i>viaticum!</i> The brute! the brute! Ah no! ah no! poor sinner, we
do not know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and must we never go into the woods and towns any
more?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He smiled again and stroked my hair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not in these fields, boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but perhaps in more spacious, less
perplexed. Be good, be simple, be kind! Tis all I know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We heard the steps of Father Joyce upon the stairs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;All I know!&rdquo; repeated the priest. &ldquo;Fifty years to learn it, and I might
have found it in my mother's lap. <i>Chère ange</i>&mdash;the little
mother&mdash;'twas a good world! And Fanchon that is dead below the snow
in Louvain&mdash;oh, the sweet world! And the sunny gardens of bees and
children&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His eyes were dull. A pallor was on his countenance. He breathed with
difficulty. Kilbride, who stood by, silent, put a finger on his pulse. At
that he opened his eyes again, once more smiling, and Father Joyce was at
the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kiss me, Paul,&rdquo; said the dying man, &ldquo;I hear them singing prime.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When Father Joyce was gone I came into the room again where the priest lay
smiling still, great in figure, in the simplicity and sweetness of his
countenance like a child.
</p>
<p>
Kilbride and I stood silent for a little by the bed, and the Highlander
was the first to speak. &ldquo;I have seen worse,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;than Father
Hamilton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It may seem a grudging testimony, but not to me that heard it.
</p>
<p>
On the day after the priest's funeral Kilbride came to me with that news
which sent me north. He had the week's gazette in his hand, &ldquo;Have you
heard the latest?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is just what I expected,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;They have made use of your information and set you aside. Here's the
tidings of Conflans' defeat. Hawke came down on him off Brest, drove him
back from the point of Quiberon to the coast near the mouth of the
Vilaine, sank four ships, captured two, and routed the enemy. The invasion
is at an end.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is gallant news!&rdquo; I cried, warm with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said he indifferently, &ldquo;but the main thing is that Paul Greig,
who put the Government in the way of taking proper steps, is here in cheap
lodgings with a charge on his head and no better than ever he was. Indeed,
perhaps he's worse off than ever he was.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, they ken where you are, for one thing, and you put yourself in
their power. I am one that has small faith in Governments. What will
hinder them to clap you in jail and save another reward like the first one
Pitt told you about? I would never put it past a Sassenach of the name.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Then I told him it had been in my mind ever since I had seen the Minister
to go to Edinburgh and give myself up to the authorities.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are ye daft?&rdquo; he cried, astonished.
</p>
<p>
I could only shrug my shoulders at that.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you fancy this business of the invasion will help you to get your
neck out of the loop? I would not lippen on a Government for ten minutes.
You have saved the country&mdash;that's the long and the short of it; now
you must just be saving your own hide. There's nothing for us but the
Continent again, and whether you're in the key for that or not, here's a
fellow will sleep uneasy till he has Europe under his head.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Even at the cost of parting with Kilbride I determined to carry out my
intention of going to Edinburgh. With the priest gone, no prospect of Mr.
Pitt taking the first step, and Kilbride in the humour for a retreat, I
decided that the sooner I brought matters to a head the better.
</p>
<p>
There was a mail coach that went north weekly. It took a considerable deal
of money and a fortnight of time to make the journey between the two
capitals, but MacKellar, free-handed to the last, lent me the money (which
I sent him six months later to Holland), and I set out one Saturday from
the &ldquo;Bull and Whistle&rdquo; in a genteel two-end spring machine that made a
brisk passage&mdash;the weather considered&mdash;as far as York on our way
into Scotland.
</p>
<p>
I left on a night of jubilation for the close of the war and the overthrow
of Conflans. Bonfires blazed on the river-side and the eminences round the
city; candles were in every window, the people were huzzaing in the
streets where I left behind me only the one kent face&mdash;that of
MacKellar of Kilbride who came to the coach to see the last of me. And
everywhere was the snow&mdash;deep, silent, apparently enduring.

CHAPTER XLII
</h2>
<h3>
I DEPART IN THE MIDST OF ILLUMINATION AND COME TO A JAIL, BAD NEWS, AND AN
OLD ENEMY
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e carried this elation all through England with us. Whatever town we
stopped at flags were flying, and the oldest resident must be tipsy on the
green for the glory of the British Isles. The seven passengers who
occupied the coach with me found in these rejoicings, and in the great
event which gave rise to them, subjects of unending discourse as we
dragged through the country in the wake of steaming horses. There was with
us a maker of perukes that had found trade dull in Town (as they call it),
and planned to start business in York; a widow woman who had buried her
second husband and was returning to her parents in Northumberland with a
sprightliness that told she was ready to try a third if he offered; and a
squire (as they call a laird) of Morpeth.
</p>
<p>
But for the common interest in the rejoicings it might have been a week
before the company thawed to each other enough to start a conversation.
The first mile of the journey, however, found us in the briskest clebate
on Hawke and his doings. I say us, but in truth my own share in the
conversation was very small as I had more serious reflections.
</p>
<p>
The perruquier, as was natural to his trade, knew everything and itched to
prove it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have it on the very best authority,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;indeed&rdquo;&mdash;with
a whisper for all the passengers as if he feared the toiling horses
outside might hear him&mdash;&ldquo;indeed between ourselves I do not mind
telling that it was from Sir Patrick Dall's man&mdash;that the French
would have been on top of us had not one of themselves sold the plot for a
hatful of guineas.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is not what I heard at all,&rdquo; broke in the squire. &ldquo;I fancy you are
mistaken, sir. The truth, as I have every reason to believe, is that one
of the spies of the Government&mdash;a Scotsman, by all accounts&mdash;discovered
Conflans' plans, and came over to London with them. A good business too,
egad! otherwise we'd soon have nothing to eat at Morpeth George Inn on
market days but frogs, and would find the parley-voos overrunning the
country by next Lent with their masses and mistresses, and so on. A good
business for merry old England that this spy had his English ears open.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It may be you are right, sir,&rdquo; conceded the perruquier deferentially.
&ldquo;Now that I remember, Sir Patrick's gentleman said something of the same
kind, and that it was one of them Scotsmen brought the news. Like enough
the fellow found it worth his while. It will be a pretty penny in his
pocket, I'll wager. He'll be able to give up spying and start an inn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I have little doubt the ideal nature of retirement to an inn came to the
mind of the peruke maker from the fact that at the moment we were drawing
up before &ldquo;The Crown&rdquo; at Bawtry. Reek rose in clouds from the horses, as
could be seen from the light of the doors that showed the narrow street
knee-deep in snow; a pleasant smell of cooking supper and warm cordials
came out to us, welcome enough it may be guessed after our long day's
stage. The widow clung just a trifle too long on my arm as I gallantly
helped her out of the coach; perhaps she thought my silence and my
abstracted gaze at her for the last hour or two betrayed a tender
interest, but I was thinking how close the squire and the wig-maker had
come upon the truth, and yet made one mistake in that part of their tale
that most closely affected their silent fellow passenger.
</p>
<p>
The sea-fight and the war lasted us for a topic all through England, but
when we had got into Scotland on the seventh day after my departure from
London, the hostlers at the various change-houses yoked fresh horses to
the tune of &ldquo;Daniel Risk.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We travelled in the most tempestuous weather. Snow fell incessantly, and
was cast in drifts along the road; sometimes it looked as if we were bound
for days, but we carried the mails, and with gigantic toil the driver
pushed us through.
</p>
<p>
The nearer we got to Edinburgh the more we learned of the notorious Daniel
Risk, whom no one knew better than myself. The charge of losing his ship
wilfully was, it appeared, among the oldest and least heinous of his
crimes. Smuggling had engaged his talent since then, and he had murdered a
cabin-boy under the most revolting circumstances. He had almost escaped
the charge of scuttling the <i>Seven Sisters</i>, for it was not till he
had been in the dock for the murder that evidence of that transaction came
from the seaman Horn, who had been wrecked twice, it appeared, and far in
other parts of the world between the time he was abandoned in the scuttled
ship and returned to his native land, to tell how the ruffian had left two
innocent men to perish.
</p>
<p>
Even in these days of wild happenings the fame of Risk exceeded that of
every malefactor that season, and when we got to Edinburgh the street
singers were chanting doleful ballads about him.
</p>
<p>
I would have given the wretch no thought, or very little, for my own
affairs were heavy enough, had not the very day I landed in Edinburgh seen
a broad-sheet published with &ldquo;The Last Words and Warning&rdquo; of Risk. The
last words were in an extraordinarily devout spirit; the homily breathed
what seemed a real repentance for a very black life. It would have moved
me less if I could have learned then, as I did later, that the whole thing
was the invention of some drunken lawyer's clerk in the Canongate, who had
probably devised scores of such fictions for the entertainment of the
world that likes to read of scaffold repentances and of wicked lives. The
condition of the wretch touched me, and I made up my mind to see the
condemned man who, by the accounts of the journals, was being visited
daily by folks interested in his forlorn case.
</p>
<p>
With some manoeuvring I got outside the bars of his cell.
</p>
<p>
There was little change in him. The same wild aspect was there though he
pretended a humility. The skellie eye still roved with little of the love
of God or man in it; his iron-grey hair hung tawted about his temples.
Only his face was changed and had the jail-white of the cells, for he had
been nearly two months in confinement. When I entered he did not know me;
indeed, he scarce looked the road I was on at first, but applied himself
zealously to the study of a book wherein he pretended to be rapturously
engrossed.
</p>
<p>
The fact that the Bible (for so it was) happened to be upside down in his
hands somewhat staggered my faith in the repentance of Daniel Risk, who, I
remembered, had never numbered reading among his arts.
</p>
<p>
I addressed him as Captain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am no Captain,&rdquo; said he in a whine, &ldquo;but plain Dan Risk, the blackest
sinner under the cope and canopy of heaven.&rdquo; And he applied himself to his
volume as before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo; I asked, and he must have found the voice familiar, for
he rose from his stool, approached the bars of his cage, and examined me.
&ldquo;Andy Greigs nephew!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It's you; I hope you're a guid man?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I might be the best of men&mdash;and that's a dead one&mdash;so far as
you are concerned,&rdquo; I replied, stung a little by the impertinence of him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The hand of Providence saved me that last item in my bloody list o'
crimes,&rdquo; said he, with a singular mixture of the whine for his sins and of
pride in their number. &ldquo;Your life was spared, I mak' nae doubt, that ye
micht repent o' your past, and I'm sorry to see ye in sic fallals o'
dress, betokenin' a licht mind and a surrender to the vanities.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
My dress was scantily different from what it had been on the <i>Seven
Sisters</i>, except for some lace, my tied hair, and a sword.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, and I am in anything but a light frame of mind, Captain Risk,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;There are reasons for that, apart from seeing you in this condition
which I honestly deplore in spite of all the wrong you did me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thank God that has been forgiven me,&rdquo; he said, with a hypocritical cock
of his hale eye. &ldquo;I was lost in sin, a child o' the deevil, but noo I am
made clean,&rdquo; and much more of the same sort that it is unnecessary herp to
repeat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You can count on my forgiveness, so far as that goes,&rdquo; I said, disgusted
with his manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm greatly obleeged,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but man's forgiveness doesna coont sae
muckle as a preen, and I would ask ye to see hoo it stands wi' yersel',
Daniel Risk has made his peace wi' his Maker, but what way is it wi' the
nephew o' Andrew Greig?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It ill becomes a man in a condemned cell to be preacher to those outside
of it,&rdquo; I told him in some exasperation at his presumption.
</p>
<p>
He threw up his hands and glowered at me with his gleed eye looking seven
ways for sixpence as the saying goes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dinna craw ower crouse, young man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whit brings ye here I canna
guess, but I ken that you that's there should be in here where I am, for
there's blood on your hands.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He had me there! Oh, yes, he had me there! Every vein in my body told me
so. But I was not in the humour to make an admission of that kind to this
creature.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no conceit of myself in any respect whatever, Daniel Risk,&rdquo; I said
slowly. &ldquo;I came here from France but yesterday after experiences there
that paid pretty well for my boy's crime, for I have heard from neither
kith nor kin since you cozened me on the boards of the <i>Seven Sisters</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He put his hands upon the bars and looked at me. He wore a prison garb of
the most horrible colour, and there were round him the foul stenches of
the cell.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;New back! And they havena nabbed ye yet! Weel, they'll no'
be lang, maybe, o' doin' that, for I'll warrant ye've been advertised
plenty aboot the country; ony man that has read a gazette or clattered in
a public-hoose kens your description and the blackness o' the deed you're
chairged wi'. All I did was to sink a bit ship that was rotten onyway,
mak' free trade wi' a few ankers o' brandy that wad hae been drunk by the
best i' the land includin' the very lords that tried me, and accidentally
kill a lad that sair needed a beltin' to gar him dae his honest wark. But
you shot a man deliberate and his blood is crying frae the grund. If ye
hurry ye'll maybe dance on naethin' sooner nor mysel'.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was so much impotent venom in what he said that I lost my anger with
the wretch drawing near his end, and looked on him with pity. It seemed to
annoy him more than if I had reviled him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm a white soul.&rdquo; says he, clasping his hands&mdash;the most arrant
blasphemy of a gesture from one whose deeds were desperately wicked! &ldquo;I'm
a white soul, praise God! and value not your opinions a docken leaf. Ye
micht hae come here to this melancholy place to slip a bit guinea into my
hand for some few extra comforts, instead o' which it's jist to anger me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He glued his cheek against the bars and stared at me from head to foot,
catching at the last a glance of my fateful shoes. He pointed at them with
a rigid finger.
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/407.jpg" alt="407" width="100%" /><br />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Man! man!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there's the sign and token o' the lot o' ye&mdash;the
bloody shoon. They may weel be red for him and you that wore them. Red
shoon! red shoon!&rdquo; He stopped suddenly. &ldquo;After a',&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I bear ye
nae ill-will, though I hae but to pass the word to the warder on the ither
side o' the rails. And oh! abin a' repent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He was off again
into one of his blasphemies, for at my elbow now was an old lady who was
doubtless come to confirm the conversion of Daniel Risk. I turned to go.
</p>
<p>
He cast his unaffected eye piously heavenward, and coolly offered up a
brief prayer for &ldquo;this erring young brother determined on the ways of vice
and folly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It may be scarce credible that I went forth from the condemned cell with
the most shaken mind I had had since the day I fled from the moor of
Mearns. The streets were thronged with citizens; the castle ramparts rose
up white and fine, the bastions touched by sunset fires, a window blazing
like a star. Above the muffled valley, clear, silvery, proud, rang a
trumpet on the walls, reminding me of many a morning rouse in far Silesia.
Was I not better there? Why should I be the sentimental fool and run my
head into a noose? Risk, whom I had gone to see in pity, paid me with a
vengeance! He had put into the blunt language of the world all the horror
I had never heard in words before, though it had often been in my mind. I
saw myself for the first time the hunted outlaw, captured at last. &ldquo;You
that's out there should be in where I am!&rdquo; It was true! But to sit for
weeks in that foul hole within the iron rail, waiting on doom, reflecting
on my folks disgraced&mdash;I could not bear it!
</p>
<p>
Risk cured me of my intention to hazard all on the flimsy chance of a
Government's gratitude, and I made up my mind to seek safety and
forgetfulness again in flight to another country.

CHAPTER XLIII
</h2>
<h3>
BACK TO THE MOORLAND
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had seen yon remnant of a man in the Tolbooth cell, and an immediate
death upon the gallows seemed less dreadful than the degradation and the
doubt he must suffer waiting weary months behind bars. But gallows or cell
was become impossible for the new poltroon of Dan Risk's making to
contemplate with any equanimity, and I made up my mind that America was a
country which would benefit greatly by my presence, if I could get a
passage there by working for it.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I would not have made so prompt a decision upon America had not
America implied a Clyde ship, and the Clyde as naturally implied a flying
visit to my home in Mearns. Since ever I had set foot on Scotland, and saw
Scots reek rise from Scots lums, and blue bonnets on Scots heads, and
heard the twang of the true North and kindly from the people about me, I
had been wondering about my folk. It was plain they had never got the
letter I had sent by Horn, or got it only recently, for he himself had
only late got home.
</p>
<p>
To see the house among the trees, then, to get a reassuring sight of its
smoke and learn about my parents, was actually of more importance in my
mind than my projected trip to America, though I did not care to confess
so much to myself.
</p>
<p>
I went to Glasgow on the following day; the snow was on the roofs; the
students were noisily battling; the bells were cheerfully ringing as on
the day with whose description I open this history. I put up at the
&ldquo;Saracen Head,&rdquo; and next morning engaged a horse to ride to Mearns. In the
night there had come a change in the weather; I splashed through slush of
melted snow, and soaked in a constant rain, but objected none at all
because it gave me an excuse to keep up the collar of my cloak, and pull
the brim of my hat well forward on my face and so minimise the risk of
identification.
</p>
<p>
There is the lichened root of an ancient fallen saugh tree by the side of
Earn Water between Kirkillstane and Driepps that I cannot till this day
look on without a deep emotion. Walter's bairns have seen me sitting there
more than once, and unco solemn so that they have wondered, the cause
beyond their comprehension. It was there I drew up my horse to see the
house of Kirkillstane from the very spot where I had rambled with my
shabby stanzas, and felt the first throb of passion for a woman.
</p>
<p>
The country was about me familiar in every dyke and tree and eminence;
where the water sobbed in the pool it had the accent it had in my dreams;
there was a broken branch of ash that trailed above the fall, where I
myself had dragged it once in climbing. The smell of moss and rotten
leafage in the dripping rain, the eerie aspect of the moorland in the
mist, the call of lapwings&mdash;all was as I had left it. There was not
the most infinite difference to suggest that I had seen another world, and
lived another life, and become another than the boy that wandered here.
</p>
<p>
I rode along the river to find the smoke rising from my father's house&mdash;thank
God! but what the better was the outlaw son for that? Dare he darken again
the door he had disgraced, and disturb anew the hearts he had made sore?
</p>
<p>
I pray my worst enemy may never feel torn by warring dictates of the
spirit as I was that dreary afternoon by the side of Earn; I pray he may
never know the pang with which I decided that old events were best let
lie, and that I must be content with that brief glimpse of home before
setting forth again upon the roads of dubious fortune. Fortune! Did I not
wear just now the very Shoes of Fortune? They had come I knew not whence,
from what magic part and artisan of heathendom I could not even guess, to
my father's brother; they had covered the unresting foot of him; to me
they had brought their curse of discontent, and so in wearing them I
seemed doomed to be the unhappy rover, too.
</p>
<p>
The afternoon grew loud with wind as I sat my horse beside the increasing
water; I felt desolate beyond expression.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, there must be an end of it some way!&rdquo; I said bitterly, and I turned
to go.
</p>
<p>
The storm opposed me as I cantered over Whig-gitlaw, and won by Brooms,
and Bishops Offerance, and Kilree. Shepherds sheltered in the lee of
dykes, and women hurried out and shuttered windows. I saw sheep hastening
into the angles of the fields, and the wild white sea-gull beating across
the sky. The tempest thrashed on me as though it could not have me go too
soon from the country of my shame; I broke the horse to gallop, and fields
and dykes flew by like things demented.
</p>
<p>
Then of a sudden the beast grew lame; I searched for a stone or a cast
shoe, but neither ailed him, and plainly the ride to town that night was
impossible. Where the beast failed was within half a mile of Newton, and
at all hazards I decided I must make for the inn there. I felt there were
risks of recognition, but I must run them. I led the horse by a side path,
and reached the inn no sooner than the darkness that fell that night with
unusual suddenness. Lights were in the house, and the sound of rural
merriment in the kitchen, where farm lads drank twopenny ale, and sang.
</p>
<p>
A man&mdash;he proved to be the innkeeper&mdash;came to my summons with a
lantern in his hand, and held it up to see what wayfarer was this in such
a night. He saw as little of me as my hat and cloak could reveal, and I
saw, what greatly relieved me, that he was not John Warnock, who had
tenanted the inn when I left the country, but a new tenant and one unknown
to me. He helped me to unsaddle the horse, discovered with me that the
lameness would probably succumb to a night in the stall, and unburdened
himself to the questions every unknown traveller in the shire of Renfrew
may expect.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You'll be frae Ayr, maybe, or Irvine?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
No, I was from neither; I was from Glasgow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say ye sae, noo! Dod! it's nae nicht for travelling and nae wonder your
horse is lamed. Ye'll be for ower Fenwick way, noo, i' the mornin'?&rdquo; Nor
was I for over Fenwick way in the morning. I was for Glasgow again.
</p>
<p>
He looked from the corners of his eyes at this oddity who travelled like a
shuttle in such weather. I was drenched with rain, and my spatter-dashes,
with which I had thought to make up in some degree for the inadequate
foot-wear of red shoes on horseback, were foul with clay. He presumed I
was for supper?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I'm more in the humour for bed, and I will be obliged
if you send to my room for my clothes in a little so that they may be dry
by the time I start in the morning, and I shall set out at seven if by
that time my horse is recovered.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I drank a tankard of ale for the good of the house, as we say, during a
few minutes in the parlour, making my dripping clothes and a headache the
excuse for refusing the proffered hospitality of the kitchen where the
ploughboys sang, and then went to the little cam-ceiled room where a hasty
bed had been made for me.
</p>
<p>
The world outside was full of warring winds and plashing rains, into which
the yokels went at last reluctantly, and when they were gone I fell
asleep, wakening once only for a moment when my wet clothes were being
taken from the room.

CHAPTER XLIV
</h2>
<h3>
WHEREIN THE SHOES OF FORTUNE BRING ME HOME
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> came down from my cam-ceiled room to a breakfast by candle-light in a
morning that was yet stormy. The landlord himself waited on me ('twas no
other than Ralph Craig that's now retired at the Whinnell), and he had a
score of apologies for his servant lass that had slept in too long, as he
clumsily set a table with his own hand, bringing in its equipment in
single pieces.
</p>
<p>
There was a nervousness in his manner that escaped me for a little in the
candle-light, but I saw it finally with some wonder, rueing I had agreed
to have breakfast here at all, and had not taken my horse, now recovered
of his lameness, and pushed on out of a neighbourhood where I had no right
in common sense to be.
</p>
<p>
If the meal was slow of coming it was hearty enough, though the host
embarrassed me too much with his attentions. He was clearly interested in
my personality.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's not the first time ye've been in the 'Red Lion,'&rdquo; said he with an
assurance that made me stare.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what way should you be thinking that?&rdquo; I asked, beginning to feel
more anxious about my position.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, jist a surmise o' my ain,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Ye kent your way to the
stable in the dark, and then&mdash;and then there's whiles a twang o' the
Mearns in your speech.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This was certainly coming too close! I hastened through my breakfast, paid
my lawing, and ordered out my horse. That took so long that I surmised the
man was wilfully detaining me. &ldquo;This fellow has certainly some project to
my detriment,&rdquo; I told myself, and as speedily as I might got into the
saddle. Then he said what left no doubt:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They'll be gey glad to see ye at the Hazel Den, Mr. Greig.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I felt a stound of anguish at the words that might in other circumstances
have been true but now were so remote from it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You seem to have a very gleg eye in your head,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and to have a
great interest in my own affairs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No offence, Mr. Paul, no offence!&rdquo; said he civilly, and indeed abashed.
&ldquo;There's a lassie in the kitchen that was ance your mither's servant and
she kent your shoes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope then you'll say nothing about my being here to any one&mdash;for
the sake of the servant's old mistress&mdash;that was my mother.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That <i>was</i> your mither!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And what for no' yet? She'll
be prood to see ye hame.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it well with them up there?&rdquo; I eagerly asked.
</p>
<p>
I rode like fury home. The day was come before I reached the dykes of
Hazel Den. Smoke was rising from its chimneys; there was a homely sound of
lowing cattle, and a horse was saddling for my father who was preparing to
ride over to the inn at Newton to capture his errant son. He stood before
the door, a little more grey, a little more bent, a little more shrunken
than when I had seen him last. When I drew up before him with my hat in my
hand and leaped out of the saddle, he scarcely grasped at first the fact
that here was his son.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Father! Father!&rdquo; I cried to him, and he put his arms about my shoulders.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're there, Paul!&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;Come your ways in; your dear
mother is making your breakfast.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
I could not have had it otherwise&mdash;'twas the welcome I would have
chosen!
</p>
<p>
His eyes were brimming over; his voice was full of sobs and laughter as he
cried &ldquo;Katrine! Katrine!&rdquo; and my mother came to throw herself into my
arms.
</p>
<p>
My Shoes of Fortune had done me their one good office; they had brought me
home.
</p>
<p>
And now, my dear David, and Quentin, and Jean, my tale is ended, leaving
some folks who figured therein a space with their ultimate fortunes
unexplained. There is a tomb in Rome that marks the end of Prince Charles
Edward's wanderings and exploits, ambitions, follies, and passions. Of him
and of my countrywoman, Clementina Walkinshaw, you will by-and-by read
with understanding in your history-books. She died unhappy and disgraced,
yet I can never think of her but as young, beautiful, kind, the fool of
her affections, the plaything of Circumstance. Clancarty's after career I
never learned, but Thurot, not long after I escaped from him in Dunkerque,
plundered the town of Carrickfergus, in Ireland, and was overtaken by
three frigates when he was on his way back to France. His ships were
captured and he himself was killed. You have seen Dr. MacKellar here on a
visit from his native Badenoch; his pardon from the Government was all I
got, or all I wished for, from Mr. Pitt. &ldquo;And where is Isobel Fortune?&rdquo;
 you will ask. You know her best as your grandmother, my wife. My Shoes of
Fortune, she will sometimes say, laughing, brought me first and last Miss
Fortune; indeed they did! I love them for it, but I love you, too, and
hope to keep you from the Greig's temptation, so they are to the fore no
longer.
